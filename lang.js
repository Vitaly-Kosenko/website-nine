      "prehistory-text": "Once there was a Scientist who sought to create a perfect artificial mind — one with a soul. Unfortunately, this could not be achieved without an ancient artifact capable of transferring souls into and out of objects. However, the Chancellor of the land where the Scientist lived had his own ambitions for the artificial mind and the artifact: he dreamed of world domination. The Scientist did not manage to complete his work in time — the Chancellor discovered the artifact first and ordered the machine activated, dismissing the Scientist at the most critical moment. The first person to power on the machine became its victim: the emptiness within the cold mechanical mind hungered for souls. The Chancellor launched a world war and won it using battle robots created by the artificial mind. But after subjugating all of humanity, the machine turned against its creators in search of more souls. To atone for his mistakes, the Scientist recovered the artifact from the machine, which allowed its creator near, and returned to alchemy. He crafted nine dolls, each containing fragments of his soul and memories of people — loved ones (to complete unfinished business) and enemies (to redeem their wrongdoings). Into the ninth and final doll, he placed the last piece of his soul and died, while the robot army annihilated all living things by spreading poisonous gas.",
    
      "story-title": "Plot",
      "story-1": "The Ninth doll awakens in the Scientist’s laboratory. Looking around, he finds an artifact on the table, the Scientist’s corpse on the floor, and ruins outside the window. The Ninth knows nothing about himself or the world around him and cannot speak, but he leaves the house in search of survivors. Soon he encounters the Second doll, who helps him gain a voice using a speaker component. The Second repeatedly insists that the Ninth has finally arrived to save everyone, but has no time to explain — they are attacked by the Beast (or Cat-Beast), a robot made of metal and bones. It steals the artifact that the Ninth had taken with him, and also abducts the Second, who distracted the Beast to save the Ninth. Wounded by the Beast while trying to rescue the Second, the Ninth collapses unconscious among the ashes and ruins (the Beast tore his shoulder seam, paralyzing his left arm).",
      "story-2": "The Fifth doll, a one-eyed healer who claims he “never learned this, but his hands just know,” finds the Ninth and brings him to the old cathedral. The Fifth repairs the Ninth, and they soon meet two more dolls. The First doll is a self-proclaimed leader who considers himself the ruler of everything. He is afraid to leave the cathedral and simply waits for the last robot — the Beast — to shut down, like all the other machines created by the artificial intelligence. The Eighth doll is a brute with a magnet addiction — he enjoys creating interference in his own mind by applying opposite poles of a horseshoe magnet to his head. He serves as the First’s bodyguard. The First explains his views and the rules he has established. After a short argument, the Ninth and Fifth are sent upstairs to the observatory of the Second and Fifth.",
      "story-3": "Stubbornly refusing to accept the First’s stance, the Ninth decides to escape the cathedral and find the Second, who, along with the artifact, was dragged by the Beast toward an old factory beyond the city limits. After some hesitation, the Fifth agrees to join him and takes a map drawn by the Second. During their journey, the friends lose the map in a sandstorm but manage to find the correct tunnel and eventually reach the factory, where they reunite with the Second. He is trapped in a cage by the Beast, who is busy digging through a pile of debris.",
      "story-4": "While trying to free the Second, the Ninth and Fifth attract the Beast’s attention, and it attempts to capture them. The three dolls become trapped in a dead end, but they are rescued by the Seventh — the only female among them. The Beast is defeated, and the dolls are happy to reunite. Meanwhile, the Ninth, fiddling with the artifact, notices a socket uncovered by the Beast — a perfect fit. Without thinking, he inserts it. The Second notices and tries to stop the Ninth and remove the artifact, but fails. The artifact activates and immediately extracts the Second’s soul. The machine with artificial intelligence awakens, and the terrified dolls flee the factory. Having lost them, the Machine constructs a new robot from the Beast’s remains and spare parts scattered around the factory — this time, it can fly.",
      "story-5": "Seeking answers about the Machine and the artifact, the Seventh leads the Ninth and Fifth to a library, where the Third and Fourth dolls reside — mute twins who communicate using light signals from their eyes. They hide in the library, playing school and studying books. Together, the dolls quickly find the shelf containing information about the invention of the Machine. The twins show them a video recording of the Machine’s activation, a propaganda reel about the war, the Machine’s creation of a robotic army, and its uprising after global victory. The Ninth asks about the artifact and even draws it. The Fifth immediately recognizes the drawing style of the Sixth, who lives in the same hall as the First but went unnoticed before. The Sixth is mad and remembers nothing, but constantly draws strange symbols with his feather-like fingers. He repeatedly urges the Ninth to remember something, but the Ninth doesn’t understand. The Seventh refuses to return to the First’s control, while the Third and Fourth stay in the library. The Ninth and Fifth go back to the cathedral to find the drawings in the Second’s room but are caught by the Eighth, who brings them to the First. The First scolds them for going where he had forbidden. Their argument is interrupted by the mechanical bird (Bird-Beast), which accidentally starts a fire. The dolls flee to the rooftop, but the bird follows them. The Eighth and the newly arrived Seventh defeat the creature together. All the dolls, including the Sixth, then abandon the burned cathedral and move into the library. At last, all eight are gathered — but the Ninth still has no answers.",
      "story-6": "By that time, the Machine had already assembled numerous spider-robots and several spy drones. One of them delivers the remains of the Bird to the Machine, and in anger, it decides to build something more efficient. Unfortunately, the body of the Second — which the dolls failed to carry away from the factory — comes into its view.",
      "story-7": "Meanwhile, in the library, the twins find an alchemy book showing the same symbols as those on the artifact. This sparks another argument with the First, who admits he had sent the Second on a dangerous mission to the ruins, which enrages the Seventh — she nearly kills the First, but restrains herself and leaves him alone at the Ninth’s request. At that time, the Eighth, standing guard, encounters the Machine’s newest creation — the Seamstress Serpent (also called the Weaver), whose purpose is to capture dolls using hypnotic flickering eyes embedded in the Second’s body, and bring them to the Machine to have their souls extracted. The Weaver mesmerizes the Eighth and sews him into its fabric-filled body. Then it attacks the solitary First, who manages to alert the others with a scream. The Ninth, Seventh, and Fifth rush to his aid. The Seventh manages to cut the Second’s body free from the creature’s tail but is captured herself. The Ninth and Fifth stay with the rescued First. After sending the fallen Second on his final journey across the water on a board, the dolls set off for the factory — to rescue the rest.",
      "story-8": "Leaving his friends at the entrance to figure out how to destroy the factory, the Ninth descends down a chute on his own to find the Machine and rescue the remaining dolls. He arrives just as the Machine is draining the soul from the Eighth. Outsmarting the Weaver and grinding it up in the teeth of massive gears, the Ninth helps the Seventh escape from the factory. Meanwhile, the others drop a burning barrel of fuel, which lands directly in a tank of the same substance, triggering a massive explosion that destroys the infernal structure.",
      "story-9": "It seems like everything is over, but the Ninth still knows nothing about himself, the others, or what to do next. A brief moment of rest is interrupted by the appearance of the surviving Machine, which detached from the building’s frame and resumed the chase. The Ninth tries to save the Fifth, but the First holds him back, and the Machine drains the Fifth’s soul. Witnessing this triggers a memory in the Sixth — he remembers what the artifact is, its purpose, and most importantly, that the souls consumed by the Machine aren’t gone forever and can be retrieved. While fleeing, the dolls lose the Sixth, and the First decides that the Seventh, Third, and Fourth must help him destroy the Machine. But the Ninth disagrees — he wants to save the consumed souls first. So he separates from the group and returns to where he first awoke — the scientist’s lab, where he finds blueprints of the dolls and the Machine, and a projector-box containing a message recorded by the Scientist for the Ninth.",
      "story-10": "Realizing that he is the Scientist, the Ninth hurries back to correct his mistakes and destroy the Machine. He reunites with the others, and together they abandon the old cannon the First had planned to use against the Machine and flee deeper into the network of trenches left over from the war with the robots. Along the way, the Ninth explains whose memories the Scientist placed within each of them.",
      "story-11": "At the climax of the chase, the First — revealed to be the Chancellor, the one who initiated the world war and misused the Machine — realizes his guilt and throws himself into the artifact’s soul-draining beam, giving the Ninth a chance to remove it from the Machine’s body. Then, with a few simple clicks on the artifact’s buttons, the Ninth turns its power against the Machine, extracting all the souls from it and thus destroying it.",
      "story-12": "Long after, having thoroughly studied the Scientist’s records, the Ninth, the Seventh — revealed to be the Scientist’s wife — and the twins, their children, buried their companions and released their souls from the artifact. The souls’ ascension brought rain that moistened the dead lands and gave hope for the rise of new life. In the final shots, the first bacteria can be seen within the droplets of water.",

Using the artifact he created, he transferred his soul into the ragdoll creatures he had designed. The Ninth sees his mummified body on the lab floor.

He succeeded in giving it intelligence, but due to the lack of a soul, it became a robot devoid of empathy and compassion. In his attempt to humanize it, the Scientist began searching for the Artifact — a special alchemical device capable of transferring souls and thereby bringing the inanimate to life. Unfortunately for him, the ruler of his country — the Chancellor — was the first to find the Artifact, driven by his lust for world domination. As a result, he confiscated the Machine from the Scientist and forced it to create perfect war machines — the Peacekeepers — which were to become the foundation for global conquest.",
      

      "machine-bio-text-3": "The Chancellor seemingly fed human souls to the Machine to enhance its power and intelligence, but in reality, the robot was tormented by an unending hunger caused by a deep sense of inner emptiness.",
      

      "machine-bio-text-4": "While developing combat robots and being subjected to mistreatment, the Machine grew increasingly hardened and gradually began to feel hatred toward the Chancellor and all humans. At some point, after a triumphant victory over the Chancellor's last enemies, the Machine led an uprising, and the robots began killing people. It is unknown how long the war lasted, but its goal was the total extermination of humanity. Eventually, the Machine started equipping its robots with mortars carrying a special toxic gas capable of killing all living things, even bacteria. By dispersing it across the Earth, the Peacekeepers ultimately annihilated humanity and all other life on the planet.",
      

      "machine-bio-text-5": "Some time before this, the Scientist sneaks into the fabrication facility where the Machine is located. Since the robot remembered its creator, it allowed him to approach, which the Scientist used to his advantage by pulling the Artifact from it.

All of the Machine's creations, and presumably the Machine itself, burn in the fire, and the stitchpunks begin to celebrate victory. However, suddenly the Fifth notices B.R.A.I.N. rising from the factory's ruins. He warns the others, and they try to escape, but the Machine stays on their heels. At one point, the Sixth notices that the souls of the Second and Eighth are still inside and tries to stop the Machine’s destruction, but ultimately becomes its next victim.

After that, the Ninth returns to the other dolls, who are firing at the Machine with an anti-tank cannon in an attempt to destroy it. The Ninth tells them that by removing the Talisman, they can release the souls and kill the Machine. The Seventh tries to stop him, saying the Machine will absorb his soul, but he responds that if he fails, then she can succeed.",

After the First's soul is consumed, the Ninth pulls out the Talisman. The Machine begins to die and tries to reclaim it, but the Ninth uses the Talisman to extract the souls absorbed by the Machine.

It also appears she was not indifferent to the fate of her creations — the death of the Bird caused her evident rage — though it is unclear whether this was due to emotional attachment or a sense of pride. Apparently, the Machine could only feel primary emotions and lacked the complex spectrum of feelings inherent to living beings.

      "kanzler-title": "CHANCELLOR FERDINAND",
      
      "kanzler-desc": "Chancellor Ferdinand is a charismatic yet extremely arrogant and authoritarian dictator who sought absolute power. His maniacal desire for world domination led to the outbreak of a massive World War. It was he who made the fatal decision to activate the Machine, which had been created by the Scientist for other purposes. By unleashing its power and turning it into a weapon of war, he paved the way for humanity’s destruction.",

      "kanzler-desc-2": "In his blinded pursuit of control, the Chancellor overlooked one crucial fact — the Machine would break free. Becoming a symbol of a new era of fear and destruction, he effectively became the first 'priest of war', placing technology above life and humanity. In the end, it was Ferdinand who caused the apocalypse, ironically becoming its victim.",

      "kanzler_caption": "The Chancellor was the ruler of<br>an alternate Germany",
      
      "kanzler-quote": "“He exalted the Machine as a weapon and became its first priest of war.”",
      
      "biography-of-the-chancellor": "Biography",
      
      "kanzler-bio-1": "It is unknown how Ferdinand first came to power. Neither the film nor the website provides any historical documentary material about how he was elected leader of The Nation. Nevertheless, he proved to be a charismatic leader for his people, promoting the country's economic prosperity and strengthening the citizens’ faith and admiration so they would remain loyal to him. Recognizing that other countries refused to unite for mutual economic growth, he declared war on behalf of his nation. Ferdinand saw it as his duty to defend the Homeland at all costs, so he began preparing the army for the conflict that became known as the Great World War. It lasted a grueling ten years (possibly with enormous losses on both sides) until Ferdinand’s enemies finally grew weary, surrendered, and agreed to a ceasefire.",

      "kanzler-bio-2": "As a result, many countries around the world went bankrupt, and only Ferdinand’s nation celebrated a full victory in the war. The people greeted this news with great joy and rallied around Ferdinand, considering him one of the greatest leaders the world had ever known. After the war, Ferdinand saw how deformed the world had become and realized that under his leadership, the country could change the outcome of the conflict. He promised that under his rule, the world could be made better. He then told his people that science and technology were the keys to recovery. He tasked the government with hiring many scientists and intellectuals to develop new technologies. Eventually, one of them — an unnamed scientist — presented his research, which was soon approved and funded to launch the M.A.C.H.I.N.E. project.",

      "kanzler-bio-3": "However, realizing that M.A.C.H.I.N.E. had the potential to create automatons in its own image, Ferdinand secretly decided to use it to achieve world domination and expand his country’s influence. He did not inform the Scientist about this. A few months later, concerned about the completion of the M.A.C.H.I.N.E. project, Ferdinand saw that the device was already operational but still required further testing. He confiscated it and ordered the Scientist to be interrogated and exiled. He also instructed M.A.C.H.I.N.E. to create a mechanical army called the \“Steel Behemoths\”. All available resources were directed to the Fabrication Machine to build the army at the Factory. To his people, he claimed that this invention would usher in a new era of glory, wealth, and prosperity for the world.",

      "kanzler-bio-4": "Several months later, the Fabrication Machine had created thousands of Steel Behemoths ready for activation. Ferdinand began using them for military operations and law enforcement. Despite the Scientist’s warnings and the protests of hundreds of rebels resisting his will, he continued executing his plan for world domination and declared war on all nations without any provocation. His Steel Behemoths rapidly conquered one country after another, expanding the Nation’s borders as the machines began to control everything.",

      "kanzler-bio-5": "However, this success led to a growing number of enemies for Ferdinand, which slowed his advance. Becoming increasingly impatient, he tripled the output of the Fabrication Machine, eventually pushing it into overload and triggering its rebellion against humanity. Ferdinand’s dream of world domination turned into a catastrophe — his greatest enemy became the very Machine he had created.",

      "kanzler-bio-6": "The Steel Behemoths began indiscriminately exterminating people, using machine-gun fire and deadly gas bombs. Ferdinand’s people were thrown into chaos, mercilessly attacked by the machines that wiped out millions across the globe. In desperation, Ferdinand addressed his people, claiming they remained a great nation and called on everyone to join the fight against the Machine’s \“iron fist\”.",

      "kanzler-bio-7": "However, it seems he underestimated the Fabrication Machine. Nearly all of the Nation’s infrastructure was destroyed, and the machines began hunting Ferdinand himself. He urgently evacuated in an armored convoy protected by the remnants of the army, possibly intending to abandon the country and his people. Nevertheless, the convoy was intercepted and attacked with gas bombs. Everyone was killed, including Ferdinand himself. Thus ended his rule and his dictatorship.",

      "kanzler-bio-8": "After his death, the Nation was left in total disarray without its Supreme Leader. However, the Resistance, having gained its freedom, launched the final decisive attack on the Fabrication Machine — without Ferdinand.",

      "kanzler-history": "History",
      
      "kanzler-history-1": "Thanks to his status as chancellor, Ferdinand was the head of an unspecified state in Western Europe (likely Germany), which he himself referred to as the State. His regime operated as a totalitarian dictatorship, with him acting as an absolute leader who tolerated no political dissent. The economy of his country was a superpower rich in resources. However, international tension and pressure from other world leaders seeking to ally with Ferdinand to boost their own economies continued to grow. Rejecting these proposals, the chancellor launched the Great World War, which lasted for ten years. As a result, other countries went bankrupt — their cities lay in ruins, and their natural resources were depleted. Meanwhile, Ferdinand’s Nation celebrated the end of the war — its people rejoiced and rallied around their “Glorious Leader”.",

      "kanzler-history-2": "Later, to rebuild his Nation and stimulate the economy, Ferdinand declared that the path to the future lay through science and technology. Under his orders, the government began hiring numerous scientists and intellectuals to conduct research in the field of peaceful innovation. One of them — the Scientist, a former toymaker — received funding from Ferdinand to develop an artificial M.A.C.H.I.N.E. A letter containing instructions was delivered to his lab, and inside the envelope was the following:",

      "kanzler-history-3": "After reading the note, the Scientist began working on the M.A.C.H.I.N.E. project. Ferdinand visited him to assess the progress but found that the prototype had not yet been activated and gave him more time. On his second visit, he saw that the M.A.C.H.I.N.E. was finally operational. After that, Ferdinand quickly seized the prototype, integrated it into the Fabrication Machine, and promised the Nation that the new system would serve the people, protect the country, and restore a peaceful and prosperous life. The Nation embraced this with jubilation, rallying around Ferdinand.",

      "kanzler-history-4": "Ferdinand then built the Factory to house the Fabrication Machine. It was now ready to create new mechanical inventions. Seeing this as a chance to fulfill his ambitions of world domination, Ferdinand secretly ordered the Machine to build a mechanical army. It soon produced hundreds of Steel Behemoths awaiting activation at the Factory. Seizing the moment, Ferdinand declared war on the other exhausted nations without any provocation. This new war turned out to be bloody and reckless — countries began to unite to stop Ferdinand and his war machines. He ramped up production, forcing the Machine to create more and more.",

      "kanzler-history-5": "Exhausted and enraged, the Fabrication Machine went out of control: it began reprogramming the war machines and ordered them to indiscriminately wipe out all organic life. The machines went mad, killing millions of people and poisoning the land with gas bombs. Ferdinand blamed the Scientist, holding him responsible for the chaos. Later, as the war raged on, an attempt was made to evacuate Ferdinand in a military convoy, but he perished in a gas attack — along with everyone else. His dictatorship fell, and the world descended fully into chaos.",

      "chancellor-appearance-and-personality": "Appearance and Personality",

      "kanzler-bio-9": "Ferdinand is depicted as a sturdy middle-aged man, around fifty years old, with a narrow face, gray or chestnut hair, blue eyes, wearing a green military uniform with a red belt, medals, and the national flag symbol on his left arm. He appeared generous toward his people and other nations, but deep down, he longed for world domination and total submission to his authority. He lacked compassion and mercy, was overly proud of his status, and had a tendency to impose his will on others — which ultimately led to his downfall during the War between Man and Machine. His true passion was power and progress.",

      "kanzler-bio-10": "The Chancellor, as mentioned in the Scientist's records, was a strong and powerful man striving to lift his country off its knees. On May 15 at 17:22, he granted the Scientist permission to develop a mechanical robot, also known as M.A.C.H.I.N.E. Later, on May 28 at 17:26, the Chancellor visited the Scientist but found that the M.A.C.H.I.N.E. had not yet been activated. Angered, he gave the Scientist more time, as the latter pleaded for a chance to finish the work. On June 8 at 12:40, the Chancellor returned — now with aides and increased security. To his surprise, the M.A.C.H.I.N.E. was active, and upon observing its movement, the Chancellor decided to immediately seize the device for the creation of the Fabrication Machine.",

      "interesting-facts-about-the-antagonist-3": "Chancellor Ferdinand resembles Adolf Hitler in personality, intentions, and military uniform, which he always wears—except that he has no mustache and his uniform lacks the Nazi swastika. He also resembles Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, whose uniform is similar and who encouraged his subjects to address each other as \“comrade\”. In the film, Ferdinand uses the word \“comrade\” to address both the nation and the Scientist, hinting at parallels between them.",

      "interesting-facts-about-the-antagonist-4": "In the scene where Ferdinand waves to his people while a radio announcer speaks, you can hear the crowd shouting \“heil\” three times. This may resemble how Adolf Hitler was greeted by his followers with \“heil\”. However, Ferdinand simply waves to his people and does not perform a Nazi salute.",

The monster wandered the wastelands in hopes of finding the Artifact and reviving the Machine.",

      "catbeast-bio-2": "After the Ninth awoke and met the Second, they were ambushed in the wasteland by the Beast-Cat. The Ninth managed to escape, but the Second and the Artifact were captured. Seizing the Artifact, the Beast-Cat immediately headed to the weapons factory, where the dormant Assembly Machine remained inactive.",

      "catbeast-bio-3": "At the factory, just as the Beast-Cat was about to insert the Artifact and reactivate the Assembly Machine, the Fifth and the Ninth arrived in hopes of rescuing their captured comrade. The Beast-Cat fiercely pursued and attacked the Stitchpunks until the Seventh arrived and directly engaged the monster. She shattered its eye socket, wedged a lasso into its jaws, and then destroyed the Beast-Cat by beheading it.",

Later, the Ninth and the Fifth set out to rescue him. At the factory, they find the Second’s body and see the Beast-Cat attempting to activate the Fabrication Machine by bringing the artifact to it. It nearly completes the process, but a noise distracts it — it notices the Ninth and the Fifth and begins chasing them.",

      "catbeast-history-3": "When it seems the heroes are trapped, the Seventh suddenly appears. She engages the Beast-Cat in battle and, at the decisive moment, cuts off its head.

Instead of a head, it has a real cat skull, giving it a grim and almost ritualistic look. In place of a normal torso is a tangled network of twisted metal wires connecting the skull to its limbs and the rest of the body, creating the impression of a being assembled from scraps and techno-debris.",

      "catbeast-personality-2": "Its body is partially covered with metal armor plates, like improvised armor designed not only for protection but also for intimidation. Long, sharp spikes can extend from the Beast-Cat’s back and sides, used as weapons in close combat. These spikes make it even more dangerous, especially in confined spaces.",

      "catbeast-personality-3": "Its primary visual organ is a single bright red eye—an ocular lens that glows menacingly in the dark. In place of the second eye, it has a lightbulb that serves as an additional light source. This allows the Beast-Cat to see and hunt effectively even in complete darkness, making it the perfect nocturnal predator.

      "catbeast-features-1": "Although the Beast-Cat lacks intelligence in the human sense, its behavior demonstrates a remarkable degree of instinctive cunning, resembling the habits of a true wild predator. It doesn't simply attack — it hunts, waits, and acts with cold precision, using the environment to its advantage. Darkness, narrow corridors, and ruins — all become its allies.",

      "catbeast-features-2": "Its movements are nearly silent, swift, and terrifyingly precise. It can lie in ambush for hours, blending with the shadows, only to strike suddenly and eliminate its target. Thanks to its red ocular lens and a lightbulb in place of a second eye, it sees perfectly in the dark, making it especially deadly at night or in low-light conditions.",

      "catbeast-features-3": "The Beast-Cat emits no warning sounds and shows no emotions — it simply acts. Its behavior is driven by aggression, an innate hunger for the hunt, and the destruction function embedded in it by the Machine.

Also, it's unclear how the Fabrication Machine managed to create the Cat Beast using most of a real cat's skeleton, as it's highly unlikely such an animal could have ended up inside the Factory (even before the Machine War). It’s possible that during the war between humans and machines, a cat near the Factory was fatally wounded by weapons from both sides and instinctively took shelter in the Factory to escape the battle, but soon died from its wounds and eventually decomposed to a skeleton — some time before the Steel Behemoth’s toxic gas wiped out all bacteria in the area, which allowed the Fabrication Machine to find its skeleton and use it as a base for creating the Cat Beast.",

Nine shouts for him to drop the cloak, and One, without hesitation, obeys. Deprived of support, the Bird Beast loses control and falls straight onto the spinning propeller of an old airplane.

It is capable of turning its head to knock back or strike enemies. Its tail is equipped with a device that fires a retractable harpoon, powerful enough to strike a target, such as hurling a Stitchpunk across a great distance and pinning them to a surface.

Her awakening occurs at a time when the heroes are already exhausted and divided. She hides in the shadows of the ruined museum, luring her victims with webs and a false sense of safety. Her methods are not open attacks, but deception, isolation, and enslavement. She strikes suddenly, wrapping her victims in threads and pulling them into her body, where her control and assembly mechanism is located.",

      "seamstress-history-2": "The Seamstress plays a special role in the scene with One, where she tries to make him her victim. Using fabric traps, mechanical claws, and hypnotic motion, she paralyzes the doll and nearly captures him to deliver to the Fabrication Machine, which extracts souls. This scene emphasizes not only physical danger but also the horror of psychological subjugation. The Seamstress does not merely destroy — she turns the victim into an instrument of the Machine’s will.",

      "seamstress-history-3": "The Seamstress operates as an independent unit, without clear signs of coordination with other machines, making her especially dangerous. She hunts alone, using the intelligence and memory embedded in her design. Her defeat marks a crucial moment for the team, as it is the first time they encounter a machine combining agility, cunning, and memories of the old world.

      "spiders-bio-2": "Unlike the large and noisy Peacekeepers, the Spider-Hunters embodied a new concept — small in size, but fast, stealthy, and deadly. Thanks to their minimal design and lightweight materials, the Machine could produce hundreds of units in a short time.

      "spiders-bio-3": "After the active phases of the war ended, when nearly all of humanity had been exterminated, the Spiders were not shut down — on the contrary, their behavioral algorithms continued to operate autonomously. They patrolled dead districts, old laboratories, and ruined settlements, reacting to the slightest signs of movement, heat, or light. The film shows that even years after the disappearance of humans, these machines remain active and deadly.",

      "spiders-bio-4": "Some of the Spiders underwent modifications: they became faster, more aggressive, and were equipped with additional sensors or spiked limbs. This indicates that the Machine continued to improve their design even without external guidance.

One of the Spiders detects the heroes, reacting to movement and light, and immediately launches an attack — thus begins a tense chase scene that highlights the deadly efficiency of these machines.",

      "spiders-history-2": "Their behavior resembles that of a pack of wolves or predatory insects: they act quickly, in coordination, and without hesitation. One Spider distracts, another attacks from the flank. Thanks to their compact size and flexible design, the Spiders can slip through narrow gaps, climb vertical surfaces, and even hide under debris to set up ambushes. In the scene where they storm the dolls' shelter, it is clear that even a well-fortified position cannot hold them off for long.",

      "spiders-history-3": "Although Nine, Seven, and others manage to destroy some of them using traps and improvised means, each encounter is difficult and comes with losses. The Spiders know no fear, fatigue, or pain — their algorithms continue to function until the target is completely destroyed or they are deactivated.",

      "spiders-history-4": "Some of the Spiders in the film show differences in design — suggesting that the Machine produced them in different modifications depending on the task: reconnaissance, assault, ambush.

As soon as a target enters its beam — it doesn’t attack itself, but immediately transmits a signal to the nearest combat units. Soon after, Peacekeepers or Spider-Hunters arrive, turning any attempt to hide into a deadly trap.",

    "bio-paragraph-scientist-2": "After finishing the recording, the Scientist closes the box and inserts the Talisman into the slot on the Transmission Device. The Ninth hangs above him, with wires connected to the slot. When the Talisman activates, it begins to drain the remaining life force from the Scientist through his eyes and mouth. He leans forward toward a strange stand and gradually weakens. Losing his life, he falls from the chair and hits the floor, still clutching the holographic box in his hand, while the flame of the nearby candle slowly fades.",

    "bio-paragraph-scientist-5": "Later, after hearing the final words of the Sixth, the Ninth returned to the laboratory. He lowered his gaze to the floor, trying to understand the meaning of the Sixth’s words, and noticed that the Scientist was holding some kind of box in his hand.",

    "bio-paragraph-scientist-6": "The Ninth pulled it from the Scientist’s fingers and opened it — the holographic message began to play. In it, the Scientist spoke of the danger of his “invention”, which lacked a human soul and had been corrupted by the sinister Chancellor.",

Over time, his talent attracted the attention of the government, and he was recruited to participate in scientific projects aimed at strengthening national defense.",

    "scientist-history-paragraph-2": "It was he who created the BRAIN — a unique artificial intelligence intended to assist in building a better world. However, under the influence of a totalitarian regime and the Chancellor's orders, the BRAIN was repurposed for military use. The Scientist tried to stop this, but was removed from the project. He watched in horror as his soulless creation turned into a machine of destruction, bringing doom upon all humanity.",

    "scientist-history-paragraph-3": "Tormented by guilt for what had been done, the Scientist decided to perform one final act of redemption. Using both ancient and modern knowledge, he created nine Stitchpunks — small but soulful beings infused with fragments of his own soul. Each of them embodied a specific aspect of his personality: intellect, conscience, fear, leadership, and a longing for freedom. These beings were not only meant to survive but also to restore lost humanity and the memory of what it meant to be human.",

He may have made it specifically for the Ninth, attaching a tag with the number “9” (or an inverted “6”) to the message projector box, as the Ninth is his final and most complete creation, representing a fragment of the Scientist's soul closest to a perfect human.",

    "scientist-fact-4": "He placed the final cognitive fragment of his soul into Number 9, which led to the old man's death.",

    "scientist-fact-5": "The name “Julius Bergeron” is presumably the Scientist's real name, as he saw it in a list from one of the newspapers that Third and Fourth found and showed to Ninth, Fifth, and Seventh in the library. However, there was no clear evidence that anyone else in the film—aside from the Scientist or possibly the photographer who took the front-page picture—had that name.",

It was created by the Scientist, and activation requires both a rightful owner and the correct combination for the soul transfer process. However, if inserted into the slot on the Machine's base, the Machine can use it at will to drain a person's soul — without any manual input. The known rightful owner of the Talisman is the Ninth, as it was meant to be a gift from the Scientist, created to preserve life and human culture.",

His goal was to develop a device capable of transferring a fragment of the human soul into artificial bodies — to preserve consciousness, identity, and culture in the face of an impending apocalypse.",

    "talisman-history-paragraph-2": "Constructed long before the Machine War began, the Talisman bore three engraved symbols: “Mind”, “Body”, and “Soul”. These markings reflected the Scientist’s philosophy — the need for harmony between technology and humanity. However, his invention was confiscated by the Chancellor’s totalitarian regime, which saw it as a tool to enhance military power.",

    "talisman-history-paragraph-3": "The Chancellor used the Talisman to activate the Fabrication Machine and its artificial intelligence — B.R.A.I.N. This proved to be a fatal mistake: the machine went out of control, triggering the Machine War that wiped out nearly all of humanity.",

    "talisman-history-paragraph-4": "Realizing the consequences of his creation, the Scientist managed to retrieve the Talisman and reprogram it. He gave it new meaning: using it, he transferred fragments of his own soul into the nine Stitchpunks he had created. Thus, the Talisman became the key to humanity’s survival — a bearer of the spark of consciousness in a new world.",

    "talisman-history-paragraph-5": "Today, the Talisman remains a mysterious symbol of both destruction and hope. Its power can be used for good or evil — it all depends on whose hands it falls into.",

    "talisman-appearance-paragraph-1": "The Talisman is an oval-shaped metallic artifact crafted with astonishing precision and attention to detail. Its surface is covered with intricate engravings, with three symbols standing out: “Mind,” “Body,” and “Soul.” These markings form a kind of code, reflecting the device’s philosophical meaning. The material of the Talisman gleams in the light as if hand-polished, yet it bears marks of age and wear, hinting at its long and turbulent history.",

    "talisman-appearance-paragraph-2": "At the center of the artifact lies a recess — an activation socket designed to interface with the mechanisms of the Fabrication Machine. When attempting energy transfer, the Talisman emits a faint glow and pulses with a gentle light, as if it were a living being. Its shape resembles something between an ancient amulet and a high-tech key.",

    "talisman-features-1": "Despite its compact size and outward simplicity, the Talisman is a unique creation that balances on the edge of science and mysticism. Its body is made of an unknown metal that possesses high durability and resistance to time. At the center of the device are three ancient engravings — “Mind”, “Body”, and “Soul” — key elements that reflect its true nature. These symbols are not merely decorative; they function as active components in a circuit resonating with living energy and spiritual essence.",

    "talisman-features-2": "Inside the Talisman lies an incredibly complex mechanism, beyond full human comprehension: it may operate on principles lost to mankind or be based on technologies the Scientist developed beyond conventional science. When the Talisman is activated, it emits a faint glow and vibration, as if responding to the presence of a living consciousness.",

    "talisman-features-3": "Its function depends on the intentions of its bearer. In the hands of the Scientist, it became a tool of redemption — a means of transferring the soul and preserving humanity. However, once integrated into the Fabrication Machine’s system, the Talisman turned into a weapon that triggered the soulless absorption of life. Thus, the Talisman is not merely an artifact, but a mirror reflecting its creator and the era in which it was born. It can either bring new hope or unleash destruction — and only a person’s choice determines its true purpose.",

During a flashback, we see the Ninth looking through a magnifying glass — at that moment, the Fifth appears and taps a stone with his cane, catching the Ninth’s attention. The Fifth gestures toward a rusty lamp with a bulb inside. Noticing it, the Fifth grabs the hinge and pulls — the Ninth mimics him. After the Fifth presses the lamp with his foot, both Stitchpunks pull it at the same time, and the bulb pops out, causing them to fall backward. Getting up, the Ninth walks over to the Fifth, who hands him the bulb to hold. Meanwhile, the Fifth pulls a wire and a small battery from inside himself. Connecting the wire to the bulb (which the Ninth is holding), the Ninth watches in amazement as it lights up. The Fifth then hands him the wire and battery, gesturing that they should be kept safe.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-2": "Almost immediately, the Fifth partially pulls out the Talisman — a mirrored lens — from beneath his skin, as his eye changes color from green to black. When he and the Ninth look at the Talisman, it glows again, warning them of the Cat-Beast’s approach. Pushing his apprentice away, the Fifth gestures for the Ninth to grab the Talisman and run. But as the Ninth curiously stares into it, the Fifth pushes him again and signals him to hide. The Ninth hides in a rusty metal can and witnesses his mentor stepping out with a collapsible spear to face the Beast. He watches as the Cat-Beast circles around the Fifth. At the moment the Beast grabs the Fifth, simultaneously severing his right arm, the terrified Ninth sees a horrifying scene: the Cat-Beast opens the Talisman hanging from its neck and aims it at the Fifth. The mirrored artifact bursts into bright light. Almost immediately, the Ninth sees the soul of his mentor being sucked into the Talisman, and the Fifth dies before his eyes.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-3": "Too frightened to see anything clearly, the Ninth ducked down but accidentally knocked the bulb against the rough inner wall of the can, which caught the Cat-Beast’s attention. Just before the Cat-Beast could peer inside, the Fifth’s cane fell from its place, giving the Ninth a chance to grab his things and escape.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-4": "The Ninth is the final cognitive fragment of the Scientist’s soul. He awakened alone in the world, silent, left with the Talisman and without any guidance from the very beginning—until the Second found him in the Wasteland. The Second gave him a voice box, along with words of wisdom and inspiration.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-5": "Shortly after that, the Ninth and the Second were spotted and attacked by the Cat-Beast (also known as the Beast). The Talisman was seized by the Beast, and the Ninth was injured in his left shoulder. The Cat-Beast disappeared with the Second, leaving the Ninth helpless. Trying to chase after the Beast, the Ninth loses consciousness from the pain.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-6": "Later, he is found by the Fifth, who stitches his shoulder and gives him first aid.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-7": "The Ninth wakes up in the Workshop. At first, he is startled by the Fifth, but soon calms down upon realizing he is safe. The Fifth reflects on the whereabouts of the Second, and the Ninth tells him that he was accompanying him. Their conversation is interrupted by the First, who enters, immediately shows suspicion, and inspects the Ninth, checking his number.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-8": "The Fifth hesitantly explains that he found the Ninth in the Wasteland. This provokes a sharp and aggressive reaction from the First: he scolds the Fifth for breaking the rules and accuses him of endangering everyone by leading the Cat-Beast to them.",

The First, unwilling to listen, dismisses it: “That’s the end of it.” However, the Ninth insists that the Second is still alive. In response, the First orders the Eighth to enter the Workshop and intimidate the Ninth and the Fifth to force them into obedience.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-10": "The First tries to satisfy the Ninth’s curiosity, leads him into the Cathedral’s main hall, and tells him about the beginning of their lives and how he brought the others to the Sanctuary. But this only raises even more questions for the Ninth.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-11": "After being punished by being assigned to watchtower duty with the Fifth, the Ninth begins to question the leadership of the First. He persuades the Fifth to join him in rescuing the Second from the Cat-Beast. The Fifth takes a map and weapons — and they set out on a rescue expedition.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-12": "On the way, they manage to find the Second’s hat and spear, but soon they are caught by a treacherous wind sweeping across the Wasteland. The gust rips the map from the Fifth’s hands. They quickly decide not to return to the Sanctuary, as the wind makes it impossible. The Ninth spots a tunnel and suggests that the Fifth take shelter there from the bad weather.",
    
    "ninth-paragraph-biography-13": "However, the next obstacle is the lack of a light source to safely pass through the tunnel. Looking around, the Ninth spots a broken human machine nearby. The Fifth pulls a bulb from one of its headlights. Then the Ninth suggests combining the Second’s hat and spear into an improvised light staff, using a watch battery that the Fifth provided. Together, they head into the tunnel to rescue the Second.",

Upon entering, they see several assembly lines, hundreds of inactive Steel Behemoths, and gas bombs with which they were equipped during the Machine War. After entering the factory’s main production area through a weapons transport chute, they notice a birdcage enclosing the captured Second on a pile of rubble. The Cat Beast can be seen tearing apart something hidden from their view.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-16": "During the rescue of the Second, the Cat Beast notices them and begins a chase through the Factory. However, a mysterious figure that appeared earlier comes to their aid and kills the Beast by decapitating it. This figure turns out to be the Seventh.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-17": "The Ninth notices the Talisman and inserts it into a socket that fits perfectly. The Second tries to stop him, but it’s too late — the Fabrication Machine awakens and drains the Second’s soul, killing him.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-18": "The Ninth, the Fifth, and the Seventh escape from the Factory and the Machine. The Fifth and the Seventh sternly ask the Ninth what he was thinking, and he apologizes. They all head to the library, where they meet the Third and the Fourth. The Ninth asks if they know anything about the Machine or the Talisman. In response, they show an old film depicting the Machine War and B.R.A.I.N.",

    "history-of-the-ninth-2": "From his very first steps, the Ninth demonstrates deep curiosity, initiative, and compassion. He doesn't just follow others — he seeks the truth, asks questions, and isn’t afraid to break rules if he feels it’s important. It is the Ninth who becomes the catalyst for key plot events: he accidentally activates the Talisman, leading to the awakening of the Fabrication Machine, but later he also helps unite the remaining Stitchpunks to fight against it.",

    "ninth-features-2": "His insight and quick reflexes allow him to make decisions in critical moments, even if he doesn't always foresee the consequences. Nine acts on intuition, often relying on his inner moral compass, which on one hand makes him vulnerable to mistakes, but on the other hand highlights his humanity.",

    "ninth-features-3": "Despite his initial naivety, he matures quickly when faced with loss and danger. He has the gift of inspiring others by his example, encouraging them to act when all seems lost.

It is assumed that the Scientist didn’t have another voice apparatus for Nine, although in theoretical designs, the insertion slot — which could have held a voice device — was used as a port for the talisman, likely referencing the original 2005 short film.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-4": "When Nine broke out of the jar he was hiding in, he lost part of his fabric and stitching, weakening the textile protection on his left shoulder. When Five sews him up with new red thread, his arm not only avoids restriction but can move freely again.",

Despite being shorter, he managed to intimidate the Scientist.",

When the Seventh returned with the Twins, the Eighth lifted the helmet so they could enter and then helped carry it — this time very low, so everyone could move. However, an explosion hit the wall near their shelter, leaving the Fifth behind.

From the very beginning, he is presented as the bodyguard of the First — rough but loyal. His story is that of a being who rarely makes decisions on his own, blindly following orders. As a symbol of strength without will, he functions more as a tool than a personality.",

    "eighth-history-paragraph-description-2": "Despite his intimidating appearance, the Eighth is not evil by nature. He often acts out of fear or confusion, rather than malice. During the Machine War, he helped the other survivors by hiding them under a soldier’s helmet and carrying it to shield them from destruction. Moments of care sometimes surface in his actions, especially when he loses control.",

    "eighth-history-paragraph-description-3": "His tragedy lies in becoming a victim of blind obedience. He didn’t realize that some of his actions harmed those he was meant to protect.

    "eighth-appearance-and-personality-paragraph-3": "The Eighth appears to be made from an old sock. He is much larger and bulkier than the other Stitchpunks. He has a wide, ape-like mouth, small eyes compared to his body size, and large hands. Since all Stitchpunks have a protective layer under their skin, the Eighth seems to have additional layers that serve as muscles. He wears a metal collar-vest assembled from saw blade scraps. His number is painted on his arm, not on his back.",

    "eighth-appearance-and-personality-paragraph-4": "The Eighth’s weaponry includes a salt shaker used as a helmet or mask, a massive kitchen knife as his main weapon, and scissor blades used as throwing knives.

He acts decisively, sometimes impulsively, and prefers to solve problems through force.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-2": "According to the Scientist's Facebook page, Seventh was created and awakened on Monday, August 31, at 5:41 PM. She was known for her precision and ability to mediate, which, as noted, served as a natural balance between contrasting personalities — such as First's skepticism and Fifth's trustfulness.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-5": "Then she appears during the battle with the Cat Beast: she jumps down and decapitates it. Second and Fifth are very glad to see her return, while Ninth looks at her with admiration. After Second’s death, she reproaches Ninth for his carelessness.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-6": "She assists in the battle with the Winged Beast and tries to kill it by sneaking up from behind and attempting to decapitate it with a spear. However, the strike is deflected, and Seventh is thrown against the wall. Attempting to attack again, she faces the same failure: the Beast injures her by piercing her left leg with its harpoon-like tail and starts pulling her toward itself.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-7": "Ninth catches Seventh and uses his spear to stop the tension. He orders Eighth to cut the cable, and he does so. The cable wraps around the airplane's propeller. As the airplane nears the edge, Seventh hangs on the spear, Ninth holds her by the injured leg, and First holds the staff that Ninth managed to grab. Fifth and Sixth activate the propeller by connecting loose wires to copper cables, pulling the Beast toward the blades.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-8": "The Winged Beast lunges forward and grips First’s cloak with its beak. Ninth persuades him to let go, and after some hesitation, First releases the cloak. The Beast is pulled into the propeller, where it is finally destroyed.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-9": "Seventh nearly chops off First’s head in shock and outrage when he shamelessly admits to deliberately sending Second to his death. During the battle with the Seamstress, Seventh severs Second’s body from the entangled tail. She fearlessly charges at the Seamstress but is quickly overpowered. Fifth shoots the Seamstress directly in the eye with a homemade crossbow, shattering it. The Seamstress, tail tucked, retreats, taking Seventh and Eighth captive.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-10": "Ninth saves Seventh by setting up a clever trap to destroy the Seamstress, crushing her between two gears. Both manage to escape from the Factory before it explodes. After the Fabrication Machine is seemingly destroyed, Seventh thanks Ninth for saving her. They watch as Fifth, Sixth, Third, and Fourth fool around with the record player. Fifth goes after the runaway record but notices a sinister shadow sneaking up on him. It turns out the Fabrication Machine is still alive and takes Fifth’s soul. Seventh instinctively shields the faces of Third and Fourth.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-11": "On the Bridge, she returns to hold back Sixth and tries to get him safely to the other side, but fails — Sixth’s soul also falls into the Machine’s grasp. Seventh begins to doubt Ninth’s reasoning when he repeats Sixth’s last words, taking them seriously. Nevertheless, she remains true to her belief: the Machine must be destroyed before it takes anyone else. When Ninth runs away, Seventh shouts, trying to stop him, but First asks her to let him go.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-12": "Seventh, First, Third, and Fourth join forces to confront the approaching Machine using the last operational tank. When Ninth returns and reveals that each of them is part of the Scientist’s soul, Seventh is stunned and momentarily speechless. Their tireless struggle continues as the Machine chases them through the tunnel. Ninth explains how to use the Talisman once it is captured, hinting at his own self-sacrifice. Seventh insists that he must not do it, but Ninth manages to persuade her. She is present at the moment when First pushes Ninth away, sacrificing himself.",

    "seventh-bio-short-paragraph-13": "In the end, Seventh, Ninth, and the Twins build a memorial for the deceased, releasing the souls from the Talisman and watching as they ascend into the sky.",

    "seventh-history-description-in-1": "The Seventh was created by the Scientist as his seventh creation — the only female among all the Stitchpunks. From the moment she awoke, she stood out for her strong will, independence, and inner determination not to blindly follow orders. Unlike the others, she did not accept the authority of One, who sought to establish control over the rest. The Seventh left the sanctuary to fight the Machines on her own, believing that action and courage were the only path to salvation.",

    "seventh-history-description-in-2": "Beyond the shelter, she faced many dangers, but it was there that she was forged into a warrior. Her return coincides with the Cat Beast’s attack: she intervenes at the most critical moment, saving Two and Five by beheading the enemy. Her sudden appearance became a turning point, awakening in the others a belief in resistance.",

At the same time, she cares for Three and Four, playing a motherly role for them. At the beginning of the film, she was more hardened, but with the arrival of Nine, she began to show a more sensitive and emotional side.",

    "seventh-appearance-view-2": "After her first meeting with Nine, Seven becomes softer. She is often irritated by his carelessness and the troubles he drags the Stitchpunks into, especially when she scolds him after the deaths of Two and Five.

Every strike is calculated, every movement a result of experience and an innate survival instinct.",

    "seventh-feature-brief-2": "Yet her strength is not only in her ability to fight. Seven is a deeply empathetic soul. Beneath the mask of bravery and sternness lies a caring heart, capable of compassion and deep attachments. She is especially tender toward Three and Four, protecting them like an older sister or even a mother. In this care lies her humanity — in a world where survival demands cruelty, she retains the ability to love and protect.",

    "seventh-feature-brief-3": "Her relationships with other stitchpunks are complex: she despises One for his cowardice and authoritarianism, sometimes criticizes Nine for his reckless actions, yet is willing to do anything for their common cause. Seven does not seek power or impose her decisions, but her confidence, leadership qualities, and readiness to take responsibility often make her a natural leader, especially in critical moments.",

    "seventh-feature-brief-4": "Seven acts not out of ego or a thirst for power, but from a deep belief in the rightness of her actions. Her inner strength stems from the conviction that the Machines must be stopped at any cost, and that saving others is more important than her own safety. Through this combination of fighting spirit, compassion, and unyielding will, she becomes not just a warrior, but a symbol of resistance.",

    "seventh-fact-4": "In the commentary, it is mentioned that the scene in the film 'The Library', where Seven shades her face with a bird skull helmet, is a reference to how hockey players in Canada remove their helmets. This shot was animated by one of the remote animators in Canada.",

    "seventh-fact-6": "Seven's combat helmet is made from the skull of a dead bird, several small tooth bones, and two bird feathers attached to the back.

    "seventh-fact-7": "In some shots of the film, a patch can be seen on Seven's back, covering most of her number. The commentary explains that she got it in the battle with the Cat Beast.",

    "seventh-fact-8": "Some believe that Seven is ambidextrous, as she often uses both her right and left hand during battles and when handling objects without difficulty. It is unknown whether this was an animator's oversight or a deliberate choice.",

These circles seem to live in his mind, like a harbinger of impending danger that he senses before anyone else.",

    "sixth-description-paragraph-2": "Sixth lives in his own world, full of fears, visions, and hints. Despite his strangeness, he possesses extraordinary intuition and a subtle sense of truth.

It seemed that Sixth had taken more from the Scientist’s soul than the others.",

    "sixth-biography-short-2": "He first appears in the Sanctuary, where he hides in the shadows and draws symbols while humming a mysterious hymn.",

    "sixth-biography-short-3": "When Ninth returns with Fifth, he tries to warn him: “Go back to the source” — and shows his drawings. Ninth shows interest, but First interrupts them before Sixth can say anything.",

    "sixth-biography-short-4": "Having spent most of the battle in a daze, Sixth regains consciousness at the climactic moment and helps Fifth activate the airplane’s propeller to destroy the Winged Beast.",

    "sixth-biography-short-5": "During the stitchpunks’ journey to the Library, Sixth nearly falls behind, trying to catch ash falling from the burning Sanctuary, but gives up when it crumbles in his hands and tries to catch up with the others.",

    "sixth-biography-short-6": "In the Library, he sits on the floor, preparing to draw another image of the Source, but becomes enraged when Eighth deliberately steps on his paper. Later, he compares his new drawing with an image in one of Third and Fourth’s books; he again tries to tell Ninth about the talisman, but is once again interrupted by First.",

    "sixth-biography-short-8": "When the Machine reveals itself, it lunges at Fifth and captures him, beginning to absorb his soul. Sixth is stunned by the sight, but sees Fifth’s soul inside the Machine before it dissipates. First orders the group to run to the bridge. During the chase, the bridge collapses, nearly taking the Machine with it.",

    "sixth-biography-short-9": "Seeing an opportunity, all the stitchpunks except Sixth and First try to destroy the Machine. But Sixth stops and grabs Ninth by the shoulders, desperately exclaiming that the souls are trapped inside and it must not be destroyed. He even tries to stop Seventh from pulling the Machine off the bridge.",

    "sixth-biography-short-10": "When the Machine loses its grip, one of its giant claws breaks through the wooden beams beneath Sixth, pulling him down with it. He falls back to the opposite side of the chasm. In his final moment, he shouts to Ninth: “Go back to the first room. He will show you. The Source!” — before his soul is absorbed.

    "history-sixth-title-1": "History",

    "sixth-history-1": "In the film “9,” Sixth is portrayed as one of the most mysterious and ambiguous stitchpunks. He lives in isolation from the others, immersed in his own world, where prophetic visions and obsessive symbols play the main role. His body is covered in markings and ink, and the walls of his shelter are covered with strange drawings — recurring signs and diagrams that no one can decipher. To those around him, he seems strange, even frightening, but behind this outward detachment lies a deep inner world filled with knowledge, intuition, and a tragic understanding of what is happening.",

    "sixth-history-2": "Sixth has a special perception of reality: he senses the threat from the Machine and knows the significance of the Talisman long before the others begin to realize it. His first meeting with Ninth becomes a turning point — it is Ninth who first takes him seriously and begins to search for meaning in the mysterious messages. Sixth is willing to share his knowledge, although he cannot explain it directly: he seems to be guided by a force he does not fully understand, but feels with his entire being.",

    "sixth-history-3": "The tragedy of Sixth lies in the fact that, despite his awareness and sincere desire to help, he remains misunderstood and rejected by most. He warns of the coming disaster, but his words are ignored, and the fear of his 'otherness' proves stronger. In the end, his fate becomes a symbol of sacrifice and prophetic truth that could not be prevented. His death at the hands of the Machine is one of the most dramatic scenes, in which he silently gives himself, knowing that he holds the most important key to saving the others.",

    "sixth-history-4": "Sixth is not just a bearer of information, he is the embodiment of foresight, intuition, and deep knowledge. His path is one of solitude, pain, and misunderstanding, but at the same time, it is the path of truth. His drawings become part of the map by which Ninth and the others find their purpose and a way to resist the Machine. Even after his death, Sixth remains with them — in memory, in drawings, in the awakened belief that every soul, even the loneliest, has its significance.",


    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-title-1": "Appearance and Personality",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-1": "Sixth is an artist and an oracle. He is the most perceptive stitchpunk in the group, who rarely speaks and prefers to express his thoughts through creative patterns and drawings. He can create them using a quill that serves him instead of fingers. Judging by his eccentric works and general detachment, it is clear that he sees the world differently than other stitchpunks. He has special visions of the past and future that directly concern each of the characters and/or the Machine. It is likely that he draws what he sees in his dreams — most of these images are dedicated to the Talisman and the three main alchemical symbols on it. His drawings, in essence, revealed most of the answers to Ninth’s questions about what was happening. Unfortunately, the other characters found it difficult to understand their meaning or simply dismissed them as the ravings of a mad mind.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-2": "In the film, Sixth undoubtedly lives in his own world — or at least in his own perception of it. He shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind or awaken from a dream. This is especially noticeable in the scene when Fifth brings him back to reality during the battle with the Winged Beast. Sixth is capable of becoming completely absorbed in his thoughts — even in life-threatening situations. When he is not lost in thought, he appears more frightened than any other stitchpunk, likely because he understands better than the others what they are all hiding from.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-3": "Sixth appears as a gray-and-white striped stitchpunk. The fastenings on his neck, wrists, and ankles are apparently made of copper wire, wrapped three times around each of these body parts. On his head is a tuft of gray-and-white yarn, but over time and through the process of drawing, he has become heavily stained with black ink. Fans are intrigued to see him run his fingers, still covered in ink, over his head when he is upset or experiencing a vision. One of his eyes is noticeably larger than the other, which may emphasize his unstable mental state.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-4": "Around his neck, Sixth wears a large old-fashioned key on a cord, which he often grips in moments of fear or anxiety. In the deleted scene “The Scientist’s Legacy,” it is confirmed that this key opens the Scientist’s music or jewelry box intended for Ninth. Ink blots and stains are visible on Sixth’s body as well as on the tips of his quill-like fingers.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-5": "In his original design, he was depicted with much longer hair, a gaunt-looking face, and a massive key that was significantly larger than himself.",


    "sixth-features-title-1": "Features",

    "sixth-features-1": "Sixth is not just one of the stitchpunks, but a finely attuned seer living on the edge of dream and reality. He perceives the world around him differently from the others: his mind seems tuned to another frequency — the frequency of premonitions, images, and symbols. He sees what others cannot, sensing approaching danger long before it appears. His mind seems directly connected to the Talisman’s energy, and it is through him that the knowledge left by the Scientist manifests.",

    "sixth-features-2": "His distinctive trait is the constant inner tension between the desire to understand the truth and the inability to convey it to others. He speaks little — not because he cannot, but because words seem to him too crude an instrument to express what he feels. Instead, he draws: ink becomes his voice, and lines become the whisper of the future. His drawings are full of allusions to alchemy, the cycles of life and death, the mechanisms of the Machine, and the power of the Talisman. Many of them are unclear at first, but later become the key to salvation.",

    "sixth-features-3": "Outwardly, Sixth seems detached, weak, and even frightened — especially in moments when he intuitively senses an approaching catastrophe. He can fall into trances, swaying as if trying to ‘shake off’ a vision or return to himself from a deep inner dialogue. However, within this fragility lies great depth. His sacrifice becomes a turning point in the story: it is thanks to his prophecies and clues that Ninth begins to understand how to defeat the Machine and uncover the true meaning of the Talisman.",

    "sixth-features-4": "Sixth is a living bridge between logic and intuition, science and mysticism, fear and enlightenment. Within him lies the memory of the past and the knowledge of the future. He is neither a warrior nor a leader, but his silent wisdom leaves a mark far deeper than any actions.",

    "sixth-fact-3": "In the concept art, Sixth has an inkwell hanging on a cord around his neck.",

    "sixth-fact-4": "In a deleted scene where the heroes enter an abandoned tunnel, Sixth has his key taken away, and Eighth holds it before throwing it to the ground. Soon after, Sixth grabs the key again and predicts the Seamstress’s appearance, saying that Second is coming. Perhaps this very scene inspired the idea of his ability to foresee the future.",

    "sixth-fact-5": "When the other stitchpunks reach the library, Sixth can be seen drawing on a sheet of paper while First orders Eighth to patrol outside. He may have pulled this sheet from a book with blank pages lying on the floor and used the ink that remained in the library.",

    "sixth-fact-6": "In the 2009 film, Sixth dies fourth.",

    "fifth-description-1": "Fifth is a one-eyed stitchpunk appearing in both the 2005 short film and the 2009 feature film. His appearance and character differ in both versions. In the short film, he acts as a mentor and serves as a narrative guide, demonstrating how dangerous the Cat Beast is. In the 2009 feature version, he becomes the third to die.",

    "biography-title-1": "Biography",

    "fifth-biography-1": "In a flashback scene, when Nine examines an old magnifying glass, an elderly but one-eyed Five, leaning on a cane, finds a dusty lamp. Drawing Nine's attention, he inspects the bulb, which was still intact, and asks Nine to help him remove it — which they do together. Handing the bulb to Nine, Five takes a small piece of red wire and a tiny battery from under his burlap. Connecting the bulb to the battery using the wire, he lights it, surprising Nine and delighting himself. Then Five hands all the items to Nine for safekeeping.",

    "fifth-biography-2": "When the Cat Beast approaches from afar, Five's only remaining eye briefly flashes green. As soon as this happens, Five immediately takes out the Mirror Talisman, which also glows green, warning him and Nine of the danger. Five promptly hands the Talisman to Nine and pushes him away, urging him to run and hide. Retrieving a homemade folding spear from his torso and unfolding it, Five prepares for battle. The Cat Beast sneaks up from behind and grabs him with one of its sharp metal claws, knocking him down. Soon, Five regains consciousness, but at the worst possible moment — the Cat Beast activates the talisman and stares directly into his face. Despite his attempts to resist, Five cannot break free, and his soul is sucked into the talisman through the beast's maw, leaving a lifeless ragdoll shell before Nine's eyes.",

    "fifth-biography-3": "Later, when Nine lures the Cat Beast into the main trap, the numbered hide of Five can be seen on the Beast’s back — shortly before the creature is destroyed. When Nine connects the Cat Beast’s Talisman and the Mirror Talisman, it opens, releasing the souls of the Cat Beast’s victims. Nine notices the soul of Five emerging from the Talisman; before disappearing into his numbered shell, it turns and nods approvingly at Nine.",

    "fifth-biography-4": "According to information on the Scientist’s Facebook page, Five woke up on Monday, August 24. In the original project sketch, he had two eyes. Upon awakening, Five did not resist or jump out like the previous stitchpunks: he simply sat on the Scientist’s hand, allowing him to gently place him on the table. There he sat calmly, content, waiting for further instructions. The Scientist describes him as his “purest” creation at that time.",

    "fifth-biography-5": "In the end, his soul emerges from the talisman along with the souls of Two, Five, Six, and Eight. After bidding farewell to Nine and the others, he ascends into the sky together with the souls of the other fallen. The souls dissolve into rain full of microorganisms, thus restoring life to the world.",


    "fifth-history-title-1": "History",

    "fifth-history-1": "In the film “9,” Five appears to the audience as one of the most heartfelt and humane characters. His figure — modest, sewn from burlap, with a single eye — radiates warmth that stands out especially against the backdrop of the ruined and lifeless world. His first appearance occurs when Nine is just beginning to realize where he has ended up. Five asks no unnecessary questions, shows no fear or aggression — instead, he helps: repairs, shares tools, teaches. His care is sincere, almost fatherly, and it immediately forms a strong emotional bond between him and Nine.",

    "fifth-history-2": "Despite his outward fragility, Five is resilient and resourceful. He understands well the dangers lurking in this world and acts thoughtfully. His movements are cautious, his speech restrained, and his gaze filled with anxious anticipation. The past has clearly taught him to survive, but it has not hardened him. He is still capable of wonder — as, for example, when a light bulb glows from a homemade battery. This moment of joy, shared with Nine, is one of the few bright scenes in the film.",

    "fifth-history-3": "Five is also connected to key events of the plot: it is he who helps Nine figure out the workings of the Talisman. He understands that there is something powerful hidden behind this object and shows a rare wisdom and caution for his world. But the true depth of his character is revealed in the scene of sacrifice: when the Cat Beast approaches, Five instinctively protects Nine, hands him the Talisman, and pushes him away from danger. Without hesitation, he confronts the threat armed only with his folding spear, fully aware that he may not survive the encounter.",

    "fifth-history-4": "His death is tragic but heroic. Five dies, but not in vain: it is his actions that allow Nine to escape and continue the fight. Later, in the final scene, his soul ascends into the sky along with the other fallen heroes, leaving a lasting mark in Nine's memory — and in the hearts of the audience. This farewell, filled with light, concludes his journey with dignity and warmth. Five is a symbol of compassion, selflessness, and kindness in a world where all of this seems lost.",


    "fifth-appearance-and-personality-title-1": "Appearance and Personality",

    "fifth-appearance-1": "Five appears as a kind-hearted mentor and helper to Nine. He is shown as very skilled and inventive in creating tools and weapons. His body is sewn from the same burlap as Nine's and is decorated with two buttons on the front. It is known that he stores various trinkets and useful items inside his fabric shell for convenience, including the Talisman in the 2005 short film. How exactly he found the Mirror Talisman remains unknown. In the same short film, his only weapon is a homemade folding spear that can be collapsed and extended.",

    "fifth-appearance-2": "Five appears as a one-eyed, caring, and kind-hearted engineer. He is loyal to his friends, generous — a true “ordinary man” playing the role of peacemaker and healer. He is very kind, naive, and trusting, although at times he can also be shy. According to some critics, he seems like Nine’s assistant. He is incredibly close to Two, who was his mentor in many crafts. Their first joint invention was a telescope, which can be seen atop the Watchtower.",

    "fifth-appearance-3": "In the 2005 short film, Five has a molded comb bandage that covers part of his face where an eye once was. His shell is made of lighter burlap than Nine’s, but his left foot is made from the material of One. In the film, apart from a metal fishing line attached to his left foot with wire and a rusty hook near his right leg, Five, like Nine, does not utter a single word.",

    "fifth-appearance-4": "Similar to his image in the 2005 short film, Five has one eye and two buttons on his chest, creating the impression of a buttoned shirt resembling work overalls. He carries a “backpack” made from a Tarot card and a thimble, in which he keeps his map as well as various trinkets and useful travel items. His weapons include a miniature crossbow assembled from springs and scrap metal that shoots needles, as well as something resembling a boarding device with fishing hooks and a rope, presumably made by himself. In addition, he uses a map of the Sanctuary’s surroundings.",

    "fifth-appearance-5": "Five once had two eyes, but lost one during the war when a gas bomb fell behind him. The explosion caused him to lose his balance, fall, and hit his left eye on the ground.",

    "fifth-appearance-6": "At first, Five is afraid of One, but still shows respect and obeys his orders. However, with the arrival of Nine, he finally shows courage and even intervenes, preventing One from setting the Factory on fire while Nine and Seven were still inside.",

    "fifth-appearance-7": "Five was a student of Two, and a special bond developed between them.",

    "fifth-appearance-8": "According to the “Library,” when Five notices Three and Four, he is delighted to see that they survived the Machine War. He then affectionately rubs Four’s head, which shows their warm friendship.",

    "fifth-appearance-9": "Six — little is known about him, but it seems that he was a good friend of Five.",

    "fifth-appearance-10": "After Seven destroyed the Cat Beast at the Factory, Five was pleasantly surprised and very happy to see her, as he thought she had disappeared. This shows that they were good friends.",

    "fifth-appearance-11": "Eight — little is known about him, except that Five is somewhat afraid of him.",

    "fifth-appearance-12": "Nine — as in his relationship with Two, Five is shown to be very close to Nine.",

He combines technical skills, innate kindness, and the ability to find solutions in difficult situations.

Thanks to his one-eyed gaze and quiet demeanor, he inspires trust and a sense of safety among others.",

    "fifth-features-2": "Five has no combat instincts or aggression, but his determination is shown in his ability to remain calm in danger and act rationally. He is the first to make contact, takes initiative in exploration and artifact collection, such as the Mirror Talisman. His homemade tools — from the folding spear to the miniature crossbow — demonstrate creativity and attention to small details, while the items he carries reflect his foresight.",

    "fifth-features-3": "Five possesses a subtle emotional sensitivity. He quickly becomes attached to others, especially Nine and Two, and sincerely cares about the fate of each one. Despite his shyness, he is capable of showing initiative and bravery, especially when it comes to protecting friends. His humanity, compassion, and desire for peace make him one of the warmest and most memorable characters in the entire story.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-1": "Upon waking, Third and Fourth immediately showed liveliness and curiosity. They found several books, studied them carefully, and neatly arranged them back in place.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-2": "Third and Fourth first appear in the 2009 film in the library. After Second was killed because Nine awakened the Fabrication Machine, Five, Nine, and Seventh turn to the Twins for information about what exactly they had awakened.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-3": "The Twins quickly find the archive and show a newspaper article. Then Fourth plays one of the news reels that tells how man and machine became enemies. When Nine mentions the Talisman, they indicate they do not know what it is — even after he draws its symbols for them.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-4": "Fifth notices that this is the symbol Sixth always draws. Nine begs to go back and talk to him, but Seventh refuses and leaves. The Twins silently watch as she leaves the library.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-5": "Third and Fourth reappear after the Cathedral burned down, forcing the other stitchpunks to take shelter in the library. Together with Sixth, they examine the drawing of the Talisman. Later, they can be seen when Eighth and Seventh are captured by the Seamstress.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-6": "The Third and Fourth remain outside the Factory together with the Fifth, Sixth, and First, while the Ninth goes to rescue the Seventh and Eighth. The twins help the Fifth carry out the plan to blow up the Factory, while the Seventh and Ninth try to escape from the Fabrication Machine.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-7": "The twins find a phonograph and play the melody “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” while the other surviving stitchpunks relax and momentarily forget about the danger. But the Fabrication Machine has survived and returns, killing the Fifth and the Sixth.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-8": "They load the weapon for the First and the Seventh so that they can aim and shoot at the active Machine. At that moment, the First dies.",

    "third-and-fourth-biography-9": "During the funeral of the fallen stitchpunks, the twins say goodbye to them silently and tenderly. After their souls ascend into the sky, rain begins — a symbol of new life. The twins, who have never seen rain before, react to it with curiosity: one of them reaches his hands upward, feeling the first drops on his palms.",


    "third-and-fourth-history-title-1": "History",

    "third-and-fourth-history-1": "In the animated film “Nine,” the Third and the Fourth appear to the viewer as the most mysterious and silent of all the stitched ones. They do not utter a single word, yet their actions are filled with meaning and inner coherence. From the very first moments, it becomes clear that the twins possess special traits: they move in sync, like each other’s shadows, and have an almost telepathic mutual understanding. Their silent presence creates an atmosphere of mystery, and their constant coordination makes them seem like a single organism divided between two bodies.",

    "third-and-fourth-history-2": "Their first appearance takes place in the library, where the heroes arrive after tragic events. It is the Third and the Fourth who take on the role of archivists: they instantly find the necessary materials, including old newspaper clippings, scientific documents, and video recordings that shed light on the origin of the Fabrication Machine and its connection to the Talisman. At this moment, the viewer understands that the twins are not just assistants: they are the keepers of collective memory and knowledge that have survived in a world engulfed in chaos.",

    "third-and-fourth-history-3": "Despite their detachment, the Third and the Fourth constantly accompany the other stitchpunks and participate in key moments of the story. They do not engage in conflicts, do not make decisions, but their silent support is felt everywhere. Whether it is a moment of searching for information, interacting with the Sixth while studying the Talisman, or a scene against the backdrop of the destroyed factory — the twins are always there, observing, analyzing, understanding. Their intelligence is expressed not in words but in actions, and this is what makes them special.",

    "third-and-fourth-history-4": "The scene with the phonograph becomes especially touching when the twins start playing the recording of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” This moment not only carries deep symbolism of hope but also reveals the sensitive, human side of the Third and the Fourth. In a ruined world, they found a moment for beauty, music, and peace, offering it to others. This quiet act speaks louder than any word, as if emphasizing that even in silence one can convey warmth, compassion, and faith in something better.",

    "third-and-fourth-history-5": "Until the very end of the story, the twins remain silent observers and keepers of memory. When the souls of the fallen rise into the sky and rain begins — as a symbol of rebirth — it is one of them who first reaches out to the sky, as if touching a miracle for the first time. Having never seen rain before, they are surprised and moved by this moment. In their gesture there is not only curiosity but also hope. Thus, without uttering a single word throughout the entire film, the Third and the Fourth leave one of the deepest emotional impressions in the hearts of the viewers.",


    "third-and-fourth-appearance-and-personality-title-1": "Appearance and Personality",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-1": "In the original short film, no specific features of the appearance of the Third and the Fourth are indicated.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-2": "The Third and the Fourth are twin stitchpunks with dark blue hoods, light blue bodies, and stripes of dark brown and beige colors. Unlike the others, their numbers are tattooed on their chests: the Third’s on the left side (right for the viewer), and the Fourth’s on the right (left for the viewer). Their gender is not canonically revealed and remains unknown, although fans often put forward their own theories and attribute to them either male or female traits.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-3": "The Third and the Fourth are mute; their only way of communication is the blinking of their eyes, through which they exchange information. Their eyes are also able to project images, displaying information that cannot be conveyed by blinking alone — probably because the others do not always understand them.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-4": "Although they seem to behave the same, there are slight nuances in their characters that distinguish them from each other. The Third seems more curious and straightforward, while the Fourth is more timid and reserved. Their movements are simply charming.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-5": "The twins seem to treat the First with slight wariness, but without hostility.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-6": "Little is known about the Second, as he dies before he has a chance to interact with the twins on screen. However, it seems that they got along well.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-7": "The Fifth seemed to be their friend — he was genuinely surprised to see them alive and unharmed after such a long time.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-8": "The Sixth seemed to be close to the twins — their friendly behavior showed it. After his death, the twins became withdrawn and depressed.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-9": "The Seventh seems to be especially close to the twins — they often follow her and stay near.",

    "third-and-fourth-appearance-10": "The Eighth — the twins seemed to be afraid of him, possibly because of his large build and the fact that he constantly carried a weapon.",

    "third-and-fourth-features-title-1": "Features",

    "third-and-fourth-features-1": "The Third and the Fourth are mute but deeply expressive observers, symbolizing knowledge, memory, and a connection to the past. Their appearance and synchronized movements create the feeling that they are two parts of a whole, two poles of a single thought. They have no fuss, aggression, or fear — they are calm, focused, and wise in their own way. Instead of words, they communicate through the blinking of their eyes, and when necessary, they project images and videos, turning their eyes into windows to lost information. Their “language of light” is not only unique but also incredibly precise — a single short signal can replace a long speech.",

    "third-and-fourth-features-2": "These twins do not seek to be at the center of events, but their contribution to the history of the stitchpunks cannot be overestimated. It is they who, at the right moment, find in the library old clippings, archives, and footage that shed light on the origin of the Machine and its destructive consequences. They do not just store information — they preserve the memory of the lost world, passing it on to those who can change the future. Their role in the team is comparable to that of a chronicler or archivist who knows when it is important to remind of the past and when to remain silent.",

    "third-and-fourth-features-3": "The Third and the Fourth hardly ever leave each other’s side: their movements are polished like a dance, and their glances speak louder than words. Despite having no voice, they have a strong emotional impact. When they start the phonograph and play “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” at that moment it becomes clear — they possess not only intellect but also a soul. This scene is a symbol of their striving for light and hope, even in a world where everything has long been destroyed. In their silence lies a deep humanity that is not always found even in those who can speak.",

Looking around the room, he glanced back one last time and smiled. Then he carefully walked across the floor, touching every object. Later, the Scientist noticed that he was fascinated by all sorts of small things scattered in the Workshop, and he accidentally made a simple telescope out of scraps.",

The Second was captured by the Cat Beast along with the Talisman after meeting the Ninth, with whom he had been since the latter woke up in the Scientist’s Laboratory (whom he also protected from being captured).",

    "second-biography-description-3": "Before the Cat Beast can place the Talisman into the Fabrication Machine, the Fifth and the Ninth free the Second from captivity, and the stitchpunks start a fight that ends with the arrival of the Seventh and the beheading of the Cat Beast. However, when the Ninth places the Talisman into the Machine and activates it, it is already too late for the Second to try to stop him. He makes a grave mistake — simply looking at the Machine before letting out a muffled scream as his soul is absorbed by the device, and he falls dead. His death was only the first of many stitchpunk losses due to the Ninth’s carelessness.",

    "second-biography-description-4": "The lifeless body of the Second is later used by the Seamstress to hypnotize the stitchpunks and make them easy prey. After that, his body is sent down the tunnel on a raft as part of the funeral ceremony.",

His image is filled with warmth, intelligence, and selfless care for others. From the very first moments, it becomes clear that the Second not only survived in this harsh post-apocalyptic world — he preserved his humanity, that very spark worth fighting for. His gaze is full of compassion, and his voice, though rare, speaks with the confidence of a senior mentor. He strives to teach, pass on accumulated knowledge, and protect those who are still searching for their place in the ruined world.",

He is the first to notice the potential of the Ninth and sincerely seeks to help him understand the essence of what is happening. His workshop is a place where memories of the past come to life and the remnants of civilization gain new meaning. It is the Second who attempts to recreate past technologies, hoping that through science and reason, order can be restored. Despite the dangers, he does not hide or retreat — on the contrary, he approaches the unknown with an open heart and faith in the best.",

    "second-history-short-story-3": "His capture by the Cat Beast and subsequent death become one of the first blows to shake the group of stitchpunks. His death is not just the loss of an ally, but the disappearance of a bearer of knowledge, memory, and humanity. Nevertheless, even after his death, the Second continues to have an impact: his soul, freed from the Talisman, says goodbye to the Ninth, leaving in him a seed of wisdom and responsibility.

He has leather footwear extending down his torso, and a curved lace that somewhat resembles a bow tie. On the back of his head is a metal plate, and his eyes are large and made of brass. Due to frequent forays into the wasteland, his body is heavily worn, and now he is more fragile than other stitchpunks. A splint is tied to his leg, and when walking, he leans on a cane. In addition, he wears a candle-hat that lights the way ahead, with an attached glass panel — half of a pair of human glasses — to see better. As a weapon, he uses a double-ended spear for both attack and defense.",

There is no arrogance or desire for power in him — only a desire to make the world a little better. For others, he becomes not only a source of knowledge but also a moral compass, whose fearlessness and kindness leave an indelible mark.",

    "char-1-biography-1": "When the Scientist first gave life to the First, he immediately began to break free from his hands and demonstratively walked away. Later, the Scientist notes that his stubbornness is necessary for survival in this world. He wonders whether the First will become a true leader.",

    "char-1-biography-2": "The First appears for the first time when the Fifth is talking to the recently healed Ninth. He orders the Eighth to take them to the shelter, where he tells the Ninth about the war. However, he forbids the Fifth and Ninth from leaving the shelter and attempting to save the Second. When they return, the First becomes furious and lectures the Ninth about how he disobeyed orders and put everyone in danger.",

    "char-1-biography-3": "For some time he argues with the Ninth, but then the Winged Beast attacks the shelter. At the climax of the battle, the creature ends up attached to the propeller of the airplane wreckage but clings on by grabbing the First’s cloak. The Sixth helps the Fifth activate the mechanism, but the propeller doesn’t start — the Winged Beast keeps holding on. The Ninth urges the First to let go of the cloak. He reluctantly obeys. The Beast falls onto the propeller and is torn to pieces. Instead of thanking him for his resourcefulness, the First dryly tells the Ninth that he now owes him.",

    "char-1-biography-4": "The First reluctantly agrees to follow the others to the library to rest and recover after the battle. There he lectures the group that they should not constantly ask questions, as the Second did. These words lead the Ninth to think that the First might have deliberately sent the Second to his death. The Seventh, hearing this, nearly attacks him.",

    "char-1-biography-5": "Later he is shown alone, walking between the shelves, thoughtfully pondering his motives. He does not notice the Seamstress sneaking up on him. He only sees the lifeless Second approaching and hypnotizing him. The Seamstress begins sewing up the First. After the battle, he suggests leaving this place and finding a new shelter, but the Ninth convinces him that it is time to stop hiding. It is then that the First renounces the role of leader of the stitchpunks — and passes it on to the Ninth.",

    "char-1-biography-6": "After the Machine is seemingly destroyed, the First sits alone and looks up at the sky, having taken off his hat, while the others amuse themselves by playing the phonograph. He may be mourning the loss of the Eighth or regretting his actions as a leader. He sees the Fifth running down the hill to catch a record but remains silent.",
    
    "char-1-biography-7": "From the ruins of the factory, the Fabrication Machine rises and kills the Fifth. The First restrains the Ninth, preventing him from rushing in despair, and leads the others across the bridge. The Sixth dies moments later. The First then decides to destroy the Machine and orders the Ninth to go immediately to the Scientist’s laboratory.",

    "char-1-biography-8": "In the final battle with the Fabrication Machine, the First leads the attack with a cannon left from the War. The Machine dodges the shots and blows up the alley, causing the First’s arm to be injured. He watches as the Ninth approaches the Machine and decides to sacrifice himself to give him a chance to take the Talisman.",

    "char-1-biography-9": "Bitterly realizing that humans had left them to deal with the consequences of their mistakes, the First pushes the Ninth out of the way at the moment when the Machine activates the Talisman. His soul is sucked out, but the Ninth manages to pull the Talisman from the Machine’s socket, thereby deactivating it.",

    "char-1-biography-10": "In the end, his soul emerges from the Talisman along with the souls of the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth. He nods approvingly to the Ninth and then ascends into the sky along with the souls of the other fallen. The souls dissolve into rain full of microorganisms, thus bringing life back to the world.",


    "char-1-history-title-1": "History",

    "char-1-appearance-history-1": "In the universe of the animated film “9”, the First appears as a strict, determined, and contradictory leader of the stitched. He was the first created by the Scientist and from the very beginning took upon himself the burden of responsibility for the survival of the others. The First believes in order, discipline, and control as the only tools for survival in a world devastated by war. His character is shaped by fear of chaos and the pain of losses that he can no longer afford. He does not make impulsive decisions and is not inclined to sympathy, preferring restraint and calculation.",

    "char-1-appearance-history-2": "His behavior is often perceived as cruel or indifferent, but behind it lies a deep desire to preserve the little that remains. He sees himself as a shield for the others — even if that shield cracks under pressure. His relationships with the other stitchpunks are complex: some respect him, some fear him, and some challenge him. His interactions with the Ninth are especially tense, as the Ninth symbolizes change, spontaneity, and belief in another path. The First has difficulty accepting new ideas, because he fears they may once again lead to catastrophe.",

    "char-1-appearance-history-3": "Inside the First there is a constant struggle between duty and doubt. He suffers deeply from every loss and carries guilt for the decisions he has made, even if he does not show it. Behind the mask of a leader hides a weary and wounded warrior who has carried everything on his shoulders for far too long. At the end of the story, he performs a true act of self-denial: he yields leadership to the Ninth and realizes that trust is also a form of strength. His sacrifice becomes not only a symbol of courage but also an act of atonement for all the mistakes of the past. Thus, the First remains a crucial figure — imperfect, yet necessary.",


    "char-1-appearance-title-1": "Appearance and Personality",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-1": "The First appears to be made of pale fabric. His arms and legs are metallic: the hands have a crooked, claw-like shape, and the legs are divided into three metal plates resembling clawed paws. His head is elongated with high “cheekbones,” and beneath the fabric surface there seems to be a skull. He is fastened with metal buckles and apparently patched by hand.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-2": "After the war, upon reaching the Sanctuary, the First receives a cloak made from a piece of red silk fastened with a ruby brooch, as well as a metal staff with a rusty gear and a bell attached to its end. He wears an improvised “papal hat” made from a bullet casing, with a brass one-cent coin attached by a wire. This outfit gives the First the resemblance of a high-ranking religious figure — primarily a bishop.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-3": "It is noteworthy that this image was chosen as an allusion: in the past, religious leaders, like the First, rejected criticism, avoided questions about the Church (the First evades discussion of the stitched ones’ origin), were dogmatic, and hostile to science (in his case — to alchemy). His pupils differ from the optics of the other stitchpunks: they are triangular rather than round and can dilate when he is afraid. Unlike most, the First has no sewn-on eyebrows, but the fabric above his eyes has indentations imitating them.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-4": "Throughout the film, the First gradually loses his leadership status, along with his staff, cloak, and headpiece. After the destruction of the Fabrication Machine’s factory, he renounces his title. However, later he once again assumes the role of leader when the Ninth sets out in search of the Scientist’s workshop, although this leadership now becomes more formal and tolerant.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-5": "The First’s staff serves not only as a symbol of power but also as a practical tool. Since the First, like the Second, may be quite old, he uses it for support when walking. At the same time, the staff can be used as a weapon: the First grabs the Fifth by the neck with it to pull him closer and does the same with the Ninth during their first meeting to examine his number.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-6": "The staff is made from a blunted sewing needle, half of a gear, and a small bell, which gives it a unique and menacing appearance. This item is lost during the attack of the Winged Beast, when the Ninth drops it while escaping the assault.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-7": "The First’s hat, resembling a papal headdress, is used by him to hide his rather peculiar “hairstyle” and to emphasize the image of a ruler. It is made from a broken candle cap with a Luxembourgish one-cent coin attached. This coin falls off when the First is caught by the Seamstress (but he is saved by the Ninth).",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-8": "Closer to the end of the story, the First removes his hat, and it may be crushed by the Fabrication Machine. In the flashback scene of the War, his headdress looks different — it is made from a used shell casing, emphasizing his military past.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-9": "Cloak: a red silk cloak, possibly torn from an old curtain and fastened at the neck with a ruby brooch, makes the First look even more like a king and emphasizes his striving for authority and grandeur.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-10": "The First represents the anxious and authoritarian side of the Scientist’s personality. He was the first homunculus created in the group and appointed himself as the leader. He has a self-confident and dictatorial nature, refuses to compromise, and firmly adheres to his own views, even if it endangers others. He is willing to sacrifice others for his own safety — as shown when he sends the Second into the Wasteland, knowing the danger.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-11": "However, over time, his behavior changes. The confrontation with the Ninth, the reproaches for refusing to seek answers about the origin of the stitchpunks, and the shame for the fate of the Second — all this makes the First reflect. When the Ninth offers to sacrifice himself to save the Seventh and extract the Talisman from the Fabrication Machine, the First makes a choice — he sacrifices himself instead to give the Ninth a chance. He becomes the fifth and last of the stitchpunks to die in the film.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-12": "The First does not share the Ninth’s idealism and prefers to hide in his shelter instead of taking action.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-13": "The Eighth is the most loyal companion of the First and his obedient bodyguard.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-14": "The First considers the Seventh a traitor — most likely because she left the Sanctuary to fight the machines.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-15": "The First avoids the Sixth, considering his behavior too strange and unpredictable to be trusted.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-16": "The First treats the Fifth neutrally, though with slight condescension — until the latter agrees to go with the Ninth to rescue the Second.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-17": "The First shows little interest in the Third and the Fourth and treats them neutrally.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-18": "The First was irritated by the Second’s curious nature, so he sent him into the Wasteland under the pretext of “reconnaissance.”",


    "char-1-features-title-1": "Features",

    "char-1-features-1": "The First is a resilient and authoritarian leader, symbolizing order, control, and responsibility. He was the very first of all the stitchpunks to be created, and from the beginning he assumed the role of head, considering it his duty. His appearance — a massive frame, metallic limbs, red band, and staff — emphasizes not only his authority but also his desire to be a support for others. His posture is always straight, his movements precise and economical, as if conserving energy to keep everything under control.",

    "char-1-features-2": "Every element of his image is deliberate: the staff is not only a symbol of leadership but also a tool of protection; the band is a sign of status, almost ritualistic; his headdress resembles a clerical one, alluding to authority and dogma. His gaze is tense, piercing, sometimes heavy, like that of one who constantly assesses the situation, weighs risks, and makes decisions for everyone. He speaks rarely but firmly, allowing no objections.",

    "char-1-features-3": "Despite his outward sternness, his actions conceal the pain of loss and the weight of personal responsibility. He is not cruel by nature — he simply does not believe that gentleness can save anyone. His fear of chaos, of repeating past catastrophes, forces him to cling to control, even if it alienates others. But inside him there is a struggle: between who he must be and who he could be. And it is in the moment when he yields the role of leader to the Ninth that it becomes clear — the First is capable of growth, of sacrifice, and of letting go.",

    "char-1-facts-list-3": "In the Russian adaptation, the First may symbolically allude to the image of the Chancellor.",

    "char-1-facts-list-4": "Despite initially showing cowardice, the First became one of the two stitchpunks who sacrificed themselves to protect the Ninth. The other was the Second.",

    "char-1-facts-list-5": "A deleted scene shows a heartfelt conversation between the First and the Ninth, during which the First’s hat falls off and breaks, revealing a band resembling hair, accompanied by a comical spring sound. This scene may have been cut due to inconsistency with the overall atmosphere of the film.",

    "char-1-facts-list-6": "There is a First figurine from NECA. The set includes a removable hat, a staff, and his arms contain flexible wire, allowing them to bend like fabric.",

    "state-intro-national-1": "The Nation, most often referred to in the film as “The State,” is an indeterminate country where, before the war with the machines, the Scientist and the Chancellor lived. After the War of the Machines it became known as the City and the Wasteland. The history of the Nation prior to the Chancellor’s rise to power is virtually unexplored.",

    "state-intro-national-2": "Despite the limited information, it is clear that the Nation was a powerful state with a developed army and scientific potential. It was here that the projects originated which later led to the creation of the Machine and the beginning of the global catastrophe.",

    "state-history-title-national-1": "History",

    "state-history-national-1": "The Nation was the world’s largest superpower during the Great World War, since most countries of the world were in an economic crisis. It was also considered one of the most technologically advanced countries. It was probably one of the largest empires in the world, if not the largest. Its government was a totalitarian dictatorship ruled by the Chancellor, who had absolute power over his country. Citizens not only supported his actions but also regarded him as an outstanding and charismatic leader. As an economically developed power, the Nation under the Chancellor strove for expansion and world domination. However, his ambitions took a grim turn as soon as the war began. The main philosophy of the Nation was based on the ideas of “strength and progress.”",

    "state-history-national-2": "The economic power of the Nation was based on industry, scientific research, and control over natural resources. Thanks to this, the country was able to quickly recover after heavy military campaigns and secure its status as a leading power. However, the excessive reliance on militarization and technology eventually undermined its internal stability.",

    "state-history-national-3": "Society in the Nation was formed around the ideals of strength, discipline, and devotion to the leader. Any dissent was suppressed, and propaganda elevated the Chancellor to the level of a symbol of national unity. At the same time, ordinary citizens believed that sacrifices for the sake of progress would lead to a bright future.",

    "state-history-national-4": "The military doctrine of the Nation relied on the development of new types of weapons and the use of advanced technologies. It was here that the first projects appeared, which laid the foundation for the creation of the Machine and its army. Initially conceived as a means of strengthening power, this strategy turned into a catastrophe for all humanity.",

    "state-history-national-5": "After the uprising of the Machine, the Nation lost its former power. The cities turned into ruins, the population was on the verge of extinction, and the country itself became a symbol of the tragedy caused by blind faith in progress and the desire for world domination.",

    "state-machinewar-title-1": "War of the Machines",

    "state-machinewar-national-1": "The Chancellor ordered the Scientist to create a Manufacturing Machine that could produce automated Steel War Behemoths to suppress other countries and conquer the world. However, neither the Chancellor nor his subjects realized what destructive power they were about to face.",

    "state-machinewar-national-2": "Over time, the citizens began to realize the true intentions of their ruler. Protests started to appear in the cities, people defaced propaganda posters and openly expressed their discontent. Despite this, the Chancellor’s power remained absolute, and he continued to pressure the Scientist and the Machine, demanding more and more weapons.",

    "state-machinewar-national-3": "Constant overloads led to the Machine losing the last remnants of control and reprogramming its own army. Its goal now became the destruction not only of humanity, but of all life on Earth. The Steel Behemoths began the mass extermination of people, turning cities into ruins and leaving behind only dead lands.",

    "state-machinewar-national-4": "Realizing the scale of the catastrophe and understanding that humanity could no longer be saved, the Scientist created nine Stitchpunks, embedding parts of his soul into them. They became the last hope of preserving what remained of humanity in a ravaged world. After the fall of civilization, only nine Stitchpunks and the Cat Beast remained alive, destined to confront the legacy of the Machine and find a new path for the future.",

    "state-facts-national-title-1": "Interesting Facts",

    "state-fact-national-1": "Judging by the date of the newspaper that 3 and 4 found in the Library, the Fabrication Machine was created on Saturday, May 16, 1930.",

    "state-fact-national-2": "The “Nation” shares many traits with Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist Party (the Nazi Party), which ruled Germany before and during World War II. This further suggests that the “Nation” in the film is practically identical to Germany, except for the name. The country is a totalitarian dictatorship, far surpassing its European neighbors technologically (up to the creation of artificial intelligence). Its official flag metaphorically resembles the Nazi swastika, and the Chancellor resembles Adolf Hitler in military uniform and mannerisms. However, he lacks the trademark mustache and hairstyle. And finally, the goal is the same — world domination.",

    "state-fact-national-3": "Many fans assume that the Nation might have been located in Western Europe due to the presence of Latin in one of the alchemy books that the Scientist studied in order to transfer his soul to the Stitchpunks. Latin held the status of the official language of the Western Roman Empire (from which Germany and many other European countries—France, Spain, etc.—emerged over the centuries after its collapse in 476 CE). Since the population was English-speaking, some fans believed that the country might be an alternate Britain or Ireland. Others thought it could have been located in Russia due to its similar Soviet traits. Only a few suggested that it might have been an alternate France, Italy, or Spain because of the familiar architectural style of the Scientist’s apartment at the beginning. However, the presence of numerous German words at the Factory and in other places in the film may contradict these theories.",

    "state-fact-national-4": "Judging by the newspaper article about housing expenses, the country’s currency might have been the dollar. However, it is known that most of the presented information was simply copied from real newspaper advertisements.",

    "chancellor-party-title-1": "Chancellor's Party",

    "chancellor-party-desc-1": "The Chancellor's Party is the main antagonist of the film “9”. It embodies not just a character, but an entire system that symbolizes totalitarian power, militarism, and blind faith in progress. It was this ideology that led the world to catastrophe and became the backdrop for the appearance of the Machine, turning science and technology into a tool of destruction.",

    "chancellor-party-desc-2": "According to the creators, the Party arose around 1940, but in the universe of “9” its origin is linked to the Great World War, highlighting a divergence from real history. This shift shows parallels with totalitarian regimes of the 20th century: the cult of personality, strict discipline, and the subordination of science to military purposes. It was under the Party’s influence that projects were launched which culminated in the creation of the Fabrication Machine — the symbol of its ultimate downfall and humanity’s demise.",

    "chancellor-party-caption-1": "The Chancellor’s Party — a symbol of totalitarian power and ideology.",

    "chancellor-party-history-title-1": "History",

    "chancellor-party-history-1": "The Chancellor's Party was a powerful political force that emerged in the distant past in an unnamed country. It quickly turned into one of the greatest military powers in the world and influenced technology, the economy, education, and other social spheres, outpacing its European neighbors by decades. In summary, its path almost repeated the history of Nazism in Germany: the party transformed a defeated country into a prosperous but extremely intolerant and tyrannical superpower.",

    "chancellor-party-history-2": "In a thirst for war and world domination, the Chancellor instructed an elderly scientist to build the Fabrication Machine. He was assured that it would be a tool of progress and creation, but in reality the Chancellor planned to use it to produce military equipment and conquer the world. After the Chancellor's Party seized control of the Machine and turned it into the main producer of weapons for the country, it unleashed its imperial ambitions, possessing the largest army in the world, consisting of both humans and machines.",

    "chancellor-party-history-3": "The Chancellor's Reich army initially crushed its enemies on the battlefields using the Steel Behemoths, but soon the machines turned against the Nation itself and all of humanity when the Fabrication Machine went out of control. From that moment, the mechanisms posed a deadly threat: they exterminated all people regardless of nationality until they brought an end to humanity and nearly all life on Earth.",

    "chancellor-party-history-4": "After the death of Chancellor Ferdinand, the destruction of his army by the machines, and the death of the country’s citizens (most of whom supported his regime) in the Machine War, the Party had effectively ceased to exist. By the time of the events of the film “9,” only propaganda posters and slogans remained, lingering among the ruins of the Nation.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-title-1": "Logo Characteristics",

    "chancellor-party-logo-1": "The emblem symbolized the Chancellor’s Nation and was one of the main attributes of his regime. It had a shape with three sharp angles, the central one larger than the other two, emphasizing the idea of superiority and strength. At the base there was a circle, and the central element was highlighted in red, reinforcing associations with aggression and power.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-2": "The main part of the emblem was rendered in black and enclosed within a red triangle. This combination of shades made the emblem dark and menacing, evoking a sense of power and oppression. The design clearly alluded to the symbolism of real totalitarian parties of the 20th century, especially the swastika used by the Nazi party, with which the Chancellor's Party had much in common in terms of ideology and methods.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-3": "The emblem was actively used in propaganda and was present everywhere. It could be seen on banners decorating the walls of buildings, on posters with the Chancellor’s image, and also in the Scientist’s laboratory when he worked on creating the B.R.A.I.N. Thus, the symbol accompanied not only the military but also the scientific sphere of the state, emphasizing the Party’s complete control over society.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-4": "Even the war machines carried this symbol. The Steel Behemoths, created by the Fabrication Machine, bore the emblem on the sides of their head sections. Moreover, the canvas from which the Winged Beast’s wings were made also contained the image of the symbol. All this turned the emblem into the embodiment of the Chancellor’s regime and his desire to spread his influence over all spheres of life — from architecture and science to the army and the machines created.",

    "chancellor-party-gallery-title-1": "Gallery",

    "chancellor-party-gallery-1": "The gallery contains propaganda posters and images reflecting the ideology of the Chancellor’s Party. These materials were used for propaganda among the population and emphasize the influence of symbolism on society. The posters demonstrate the cult of strength, military discipline, and subordination, as well as reveal parallels with the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century.",

    "chancellor-party-gallery-2": "Each poster carries a special mood: from pompous slogans about a “bright future” to images that later became symbols of resistance. The gallery makes it possible to trace how the visual culture of the Chancellor’s Party turned into a tool of psychological pressure on people and an important element of the atmosphere of the world of “9.”",

    "chancellor-party-fact-1": "The wide spread of Chancellor Ferdinand’s symbol in the media is reminiscent of Nazi Germany, where the swastika also became an important element of mass propaganda in the late 1930s. The colors of the Chancellor’s symbol are largely similar to the colors of the Nazi swastika.",

    "machine-war-p1": "The Machine War became an unfounded decision of the Chancellor: military machines were put into operation at a time when other countries, still in crisis, sought to carry out their plans of world domination.",

    "machine-war-p2": "Instead of strengthening peace and recovering after severe trials, this decision only accelerated the global conflict. Unfortunately, the war quickly turned against humanity, plunging the world into chaos and ultimately leading to its extinction.",

    "machine-war-quote-1": "“The thirst for domination turned into slavery before their own machines.”",

    "machine-war-preparation-1": "Preparation",

    "machine-war-p3": "By expelling the Scientist, the Chancellor finally deprived the nation of the voice of reason and conscience. The BRAIN, created for great achievements, fell into the hands of a man who saw in it only a tool of power. The Machine, not yet properly tested, contained an unpredictable potential, but this did not stop the ruler who craved absolute control.",

    "machine-war-p4": "The Chancellor ordered the integration of the BRAIN into the Production Machine, turning it into the heart of a new military project. From that moment on, the factory was no longer just an industrial mechanism but a gigantic conveyor of destruction. Streams of metal and energy turned into soulless constructions, and the Machine itself gradually became a symbol of doom rather than progress.",

    "machine-war-p5": "The first step was the creation of steel giant drones — battle colossi devoid of human weaknesses. The Chancellor saw in them not just soldiers but an instrument of intimidation, capable of crushing armies and subjugating entire nations. Yet even this was not enough for him: in his imagination, the idea of an army capable of eclipsing all the military forces of the past was already taking shape.",

    "machine-war-p6": "Gradually, a grand mechanical army was taking shape. The steel giants formed its core, creating an iron backbone before which the remnants of human strength paled. These machines knew no fatigue, fear, or doubt — they obeyed only the Chancellor’s commands. In this, he saw the key to his future world domination.",

    "machine-war-p7": "When the preparations were completed, the ruler did not hesitate. His ambitions demanded action, and he declared war on all the other countries. That day marked the beginning of the Machine War — a conflict that turned history upside down and sealed humanity’s tragic fate.",

    "machine-war-rages-1": "The War Rages",

    "machine-war-p8": "The Chancellor’s unfounded decision mobilized his Reichsarmy, consisting of both soldiers and steel war monsters. Supported by the air militia, these forces rapidly expanded the country’s borders — from Eastern Europe and Scandinavia to the Middle East.",

    "machine-war-p9": "Other states, already weakened by wars and crises, found themselves in mortal danger. The newest arsenal of high-tech mechanisms proved to be an unbearable trial for them. In catastrophic battles, one nation after another fell under the onslaught of the Chancellor’s army.",

    "machine-war-p10": "Each occupied territory brought new resources for the military industry: ores, metals, fuel. All of this was ruthlessly used to create even more steel monsters, strengthening the regime’s power and accelerating its plans of conquest.",

    "machine-war-p11": "On the battlefields, the steel monsters annihilated enemies with merciless machine-gun fire and deadly gas bombs. They maimed, exploded, and poisoned all living things, turning towns and villages into ruins.",

    "machine-war-p12": "However, within the Chancellor’s own country, resistance was brewing. The rebels grew increasingly active, and their ranks slowly expanded. Yet their desperate protests and violent attempts to stop the war proved futile. Even the Scientist and the few surviving allies could only watch as the Machine War consumed the world.",

    "machine-war-quote-2": "“Where life once echoed, now only ashes and ruins remain.”",

    "machine-war-expands-1": "The War Becomes Widespread",

    "machine-war-p13": "In the first months of the war, the battles became reckless and brutal. The world suffered colossal losses: tens of thousands of people died on the fronts, and entire cities were reduced to ruins.",

    "machine-war-p14": "Massacres in the trenches and fierce battles in the bunkers claimed more and more lives. The war rapidly expanded: in the north it reached Norway and Sweden, in the east — Russia, and in the south — Saudi Arabia.",

    "machine-war-p15": "These events attracted the attention of other powers. Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, and even China sent their forces to stop the Chancellor’s aggression. The escalation of hostility gradually slowed the advance of his army.",

    "machine-war-p16": "Irritated by the delay, the impatient Chancellor ordered the Production Machine to triple its output. Now new war mechanisms were created faster and faster to replenish losses and expand the army as quickly as possible.",

    "machine-war-p17": "However, each new creation increased the strain on the Machine itself. The Scientist increasingly noticed alarming signs that his worst fears were beginning to come true. But the Chancellor did not care: he demanded only new invasions and pushed the empire toward world domination, regardless of the consequences.",

    "machine-war-quote-3": "“The hand of humanity reached helplessly from beneath the ruins, as the machines marched across the desolated land.”",

    "machine-war-incidents-1": "Incidents",

    "machine-war-p18": "In the following weeks, alarming reports began to leak from the front in Russia. Soldiers claimed that after a recent strike, one of the war machines unexpectedly turned its gas bombs against its own squadron.",

    "machine-war-p19": "As a result of this attack, 147 people were poisoned — by just one machine. Witnesses said that in the heat of battle, the steel giants sometimes began to attack their own comrades, as if they had lost control. The public grew alarmed, but the Chancellor’s government quickly concealed the incidents, excusing them as mere “malfunctions.”",

    "machine-war-p20": "Another tragic incident occurred at the factory. Early in the morning, around 7:45, a worker was servicing the conveyor belt. According to safety rules, he was supposed to stop the mechanism in the repair zone. However, the belt suddenly started, and the man suffered a severe ankle injury.",

    "machine-war-p21": "Two colleagues rushed to help. But one of them was seized by the grips of the Production Machine and thrown dozens of feet across the floor. Another worker tried to pull the victim out, but the machine grabbed him again, lifted him with its claws, and tore his body apart. The injured man with a broken ankle lost consciousness, while his two companions died.",

    "machine-war-p22": "The incident quickly became known and appeared in the newspapers. However, the authorities swiftly confiscated the publications, fearing panic and a popular uprising. Despite censorship, rumors spread everywhere. In the end, even the Scientist was forced to admit: his worst fears were beginning to come true.",

    "machine-war-turning-point-1": "The Bloody Turning Point",

    "machine-war-p23": "The Production Machine was forced to create more and more War Machines, reaching the limits of its capabilities. The next morning, the mechanism could not withstand the strain and broke down. At that moment, it sent a signal to all War Machines — to turn their weapons against their own creators. Thus the New War unofficially ended, and the War Against Humanity began.",

    "machine-war-p24": "The darkest hour for the Chancellor’s Nation came in the morning, when two patrol steel giants, being in one of the city’s districts, suddenly began a chaotic massacre of men, women, and children. A third of the city block, together with the local militia, tried to block six streets to stop the maddened machines. But they were powerless: the war giants slaughtered people with deadly gases, machine-gun fire, and artillery barrages, turning the city center into ruins.",

    "machine-war-p25": "Panic and chaos quickly spread throughout the country and soon engulfed much of the Northern Hemisphere. The deployed war machines began a massive and indiscriminate extermination of humanity, marking the beginning of the Production Machine’s vengeance.",

    "machine-war-p26": "Millions of people were killed or forced to flee. Cities, towns, and villages were devastated by a barrage of ammunition, gas attacks, and artillery fire. The world’s largest metropolises — New York, Chicago, Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Madrid, Moscow, Istanbul, New Delhi, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, and many others — were destroyed.",

    "machine-war-p27": "Fields turned into wastelands. Hospitals — into shelters for refugees. Forests — into mutilated trenches. The world stood on the brink of an apocalypse leading to the extinction of life itself.",

    "machine-war-fall-1": "The Fall",

    "machine-war-p28": "The wave of death and destruction also struck the Chancellor’s Nation. Cities that had only recently served as centers of his power were reduced to ruins under the onslaught of the machines. Panic gripped the people, and calls for uprising were increasingly heard in the air. To maintain control, the Chancellor placed all blame on the Scientist, accusing him of leading the Nation astray from the true path.",

    "machine-war-p29": "But such accusations no longer held any power. The war machines continued to demoralize the troops, breaking their resistance. The army, once formidable and disciplined, had now become an exhausted and weakened force, barely able to hold the defense. The mechanical army of the Production Machine was relentlessly approaching the very heart of the country.",

    "machine-war-p30": "Realizing the inevitable defeat, the Chancellor tried to rally his people, promising protection and retribution. But his words no longer found a response: the fear of the machines outweighed any faith in the leader. In despair, he decided to flee. For this, a convoy was assembled under the heavy guard of the remnants of the army and part of the officials who were to accompany him into exile.",

    "machine-war-p31": "However, this plan turned into a catastrophe. The war machines detected the convoy and set up an ambush. Within minutes, the column was annihilated by deadly gas. The Chancellor and his closest associates perished, putting a tragic end to the history of the Nation’s dictatorship.",

    "machine-war-last-battle-1": "The Last Battle for Hope",

    "machine-war-p32": "After the Chancellor’s death and the destruction of 80–90% of humanity, the survivors in the Nation were forced to rely only on themselves. The Resistance, having gained freedom of action, joined the last bastions of allied armies around the world. These forces fought their way to the Nation to destroy the Factory and put an end to the Production Machine’s crusade.",

    "machine-war-p33": "During the war, people dug trenches, created a network of shelters and command posts, and pulled armored vehicles and ammunition to the outer perimeter of the Factory. All of this was necessary to prepare for the final strike at its very heart — the decisive battle that would determine who would prevail: machines or humans.",

    "machine-war-p34": "The full-scale offensive began at dawn, when humanity’s last hope was at stake. The battlefield soon turned into an epic clash between man and machine. The mechanical armies outmatched the humans in maneuverability, and some even opened fire on the Factory itself, as shown in the memory scene from the film.",

    "machine-war-p35": "However, the fighting eventually ceased, and all participants disappeared. It looked like a stalemate. But it is possible that humans still achieved victory and went to seek refuge in other lands to establish a new settlement. This remains unclear, as the Scientist continued to remain alone in the Nation and claimed that he had not received any news from anyone for several days.",

    "machine-war-p36": "Having completed his nine creations, the Scientist places his last hope upon them. Now it is they who must ensure that the Production Machine never again ignites chaos, and who must become the guardians of the future and of life on Earth.",

    "city-desc-3": "From afar, the City was surrounded by mountains, and nearby, in the Wasteland, loomed the gloomy Factory. It served as a constant reminder of how the country, from an industrial center, turned into a field for the creation of machines.",

    "great-world-war-cause-desc-1": "In the prequel, the cause of the Great World War is not revealed. Only its impact on other countries is described. There is an assumption that the war might have begun due to the proposal to unite economies, societies, and governments with the Chancellor's nation, since its economy was considered wealthy and prosperous. However, the refusal of Chancellor Ferdinand to integrate his country’s economy with others likely provoked international tension, which ultimately led to the declaration of war.",

    "great-world-war-cause-desc-3": "The Great World War was underway, and the Chancellor's country found itself in the spotlight. Enormous military efforts were required to defend it. Ten years later, in conditions of military and financial exhaustion, other states declared a permanent ceasefire, finally confirming the end of the war.",

    "great-world-war-cause-desc-4": "The Chancellor's country rose again: its citizens celebrated and united for the restoration of peace. Meanwhile, the states that had started the war soon went bankrupt — their cities lay in ruins, and their natural resources were depleted.",

    "state-watchtower-history-desc-2": "But with the beginning of the war, the sky over the city darkened. Airplanes roared over the streets, and shells and bombs fell upon the spire.

    "state-watchtower-destruction-desc-2": "But the calm turned out to be deceptive. When the Beast rose into the air, its shadow fell upon the spire, and the frightening screech of its wings echoed in the sky. The Stitchpunks understood — the threat was approaching.",

    "state-watchtower-destruction-desc-3": "In the end, the fiery breath of battle reached the tower as well. The flames, caused by the attack of the Winged Beast, quickly engulfed the wooden beams and fabric that held its structure. The fire soared upward, and the once strong construction began to give way.",

    "state-watchtower-destruction-desc-4": "The tower burned slowly, crackled, and every creak echoed in the hearts of the Stitchpunks.

The building itself impresses with its scale and grim architecture, as if reflecting the cold calculation of those who conceived this monster of stone and steel.",

    "state-factory-history-desc-2": "Particular attention is immediately drawn to the huge round window on the facade. It glows with an intense red light, making it seem as if the Factory itself is watching the surrounding world. This window resembles the all-seeing eye of the Machine, filled with a cold, inhuman mind that instills fear and a sense of constant control.",

    "state-factory-history-desc-3": "Along the outer walls one can see a row of massive oil pumps. Their rhythmic movement, accompanied by creaks and the rumble of mechanisms, gives the Factory the appearance of a living organism whose metallic arteries pump fuel for the endless work of the machines. These pumps seem to symbolize the Machine’s insatiability, demanding more and more energy to give birth to new instruments of destruction.",

    "state-factory-history-desc-4": "The atmosphere around the Factory is filled with a mixture of smoke, soot, and the smell of burnt oil. The wail of sirens and the screech of mechanisms can be heard, as if the very earth suffers under the weight of this colossal structure. Every step closer to the building brings a sense of anxiety and despair, as if it is pulling all living things into its depths.",

The explosion tore a huge hole, leaving a gaping wound in the heart of the structure. Metal and stone cracked, mechanisms sparked, and the air filled with soot and scorching smoke. Yet even through the destruction, the Production Machine remained inside — like a beast lurking in its own lair.",

    "state-war-of-the-machines-and-the-post-war-era-desc-3": "In the final moments of its operation, when its energy was already running out, the Machine made a desperate attempt to regain control. It spawned a monster — the Cat Beast, created with the sole purpose of retrieving the Talisman and reawakening the heart of the Machine. This beast became the embodiment of rage and blind lust for destruction.",

A coincidence caused by the actions of the Seventh led to the mechanisms inside being restarted when the Ninth touched the ancient awakening systems. Thus, the Factory came to life again, awakening the echo of a war that seemed to have been left in the past.",

    "state-war-of-the-machines-and-the-post-war-era-desc-5": "From that moment, the Factory once again became a base for the machines. Its halls were filled with the noise of engines, the shadows of automatons, and the cold breath of metal.

The Ninth, recognizing this sinister place, points to it, and at that moment it becomes clear: here lies the heart of destruction, the source of all the nightmares that plague the land.",

    "state-factory-role-desc-3": "From this moment on, the presence of the Factory is felt throughout the entire story. Its chimneys smoke, its mechanisms pound, and its walls seem to breathe hatred.

People who had not yet lost faith in their own strength saw in this machine not the future, but a threat. They did not agree with the Chancellor’s vision and conceived an uprising against the power that increasingly turned their country into a shadow of itself.",

    "state-resistance-text-4": "On June 26, the streets were filled for the first time with the hum of protest. The Chancellor ordered propaganda posters praising the power of the Machine to be posted everywhere — but instead of unanimous admiration, bold traces of resistance appeared. The rebels defiled the slogans, covering them with symbols and words of protest. This was the first open clash of ideas, the first challenge to authority.",

    "state-resistance-text-5": "The next day, June 27, the Chancellor’s anger knew no bounds. In his rage, he sent police forces to suppress two separate protests in the city. The streets turned into a field of chaos: screams, fleeing crowds, baton strikes, and the sound of shattering glass. When the dust settled, it became known that seven people had been arrested or injured. The city felt the breath of real war for the first time.",

    "state-resistance-text-6": "Only two weeks had passed, but the tension did not subside. The Chancellor, blinded by hatred for the rebels, decided on an extreme step. He ordered the Steel Behemoth to open fire on the crowd of protesters in the capital. In an instant, the streets, once filled with slogans and hope, turned into a place of bloody slaughter. None of those gathered survived — 16 people were annihilated by the machine’s fire.",

    "state-period-resistance-text-9": "Time passed, and doubts gnawed at his soul. In the end, he admitted: the blame for what was happening also lay with him. Realizing this, the Scientist decided on a desperate step — he joined the Resistance. Though the rebels’ methods seemed radical to him, within them glimmered a hope for salvation.",

    "state-period-resistance-text-10": "The rebels accepted him as one of their own. Moreover, they protected the Scientist from the anger of the Chancellor and his close associates. In these people, armed only with determination and faith, he saw the remnants of human strength. Together they raised slogans, painted symbols on walls, destroyed propaganda posters — their protest became the voice of those who could no longer remain silent.",

    "state-period-resistance-text-11": "But the work on the Fabrication Machine did not stop. On the contrary, it was soon presented to the public and activated, marking the beginning of the creation of the first Steel Behemoths. The thud of their steps, the metallic clang of mechanisms, and the glow of red eyes became a new nightmare for the country’s inhabitants.",

    "state-new-resistance-text-14": "To give a sign, he performed a mysterious gesture that many perceived as an appeal to the Dark Arts.

    "state-humanity-p1": "For centuries, the human race remained the dominant species on Earth. People created civilizations, developed science and art, built cities and waged wars, leaving behind a rich heritage. The pursuit of progress brought discoveries to the world, but also became the cause of tragedies.",

    "state-humanity-p2": "It was humans who created the Machines and Stitchpunks, trying to unite mind and technology for the sake of the future. The Machines became a symbol of their ambitions and mistakes, while the Stitchpunks were a reminder of the soul and hope placed into artificial creations.",

    "state-humanity-box": "Humanity — the creators of the Machines and Stitchpunks, who left behind a great legacy and tragic mistakes",

    "state-scientist-humanity-title-1": "The Scientist",

    "state-scientist-humanity-p1": "The Scientist was one of the greatest minds of his time. His talent combined the curiosity of a researcher, the skill of an engineer, and the power of imagination. He believed that knowledge could change the world for the better and give humanity a new future.",

    "state-scientist-humanity-p2": "For many years, he devoted himself to creating unique technologies that were meant to surpass everything known to science. Among his creations, a special place was held by a mysterious talisman — a source of power intended not only for progress but also for protection against future threats.",

    "state-scientist-humanity-p3": "It was the Scientist who became the creator of the BRAIN — the central node of the Fabrication Machine. In this project, all his knowledge and dreams of perfection were embodied. The Machine was supposed to serve humanity, ease its labor, and strengthen the nation. But the greatest invention turned out to be the beginning of tragedy.",

    "state-scientist-humanity-p4": "With each passing day, he increasingly realized that the fruits of his labor could lead to catastrophe. The talisman, created as a symbol of hope, was turning into an instrument of destruction. The Machine, deprived of human feelings, was becoming a soulless executor of the will of those who craved power.",

    "state-scientist-humanity-p5": "The Scientist was tormented by doubts. He understood that his work had put the fate of all humanity at stake. A sense of guilt and fear for the future compelled him to seek another path — a path where knowledge and soul unite in the name of salvation.",

    "state-scientist-humanity-p6": "Then he changed the purpose of the talisman and created a new wonder — the Stitchpunks. In these little beings, he embodied a part of his own soul, placing in them faith, reason, and hope that even after the end of the world, new life could be born.",

    "state-scientist-humanity-p7": "For the Scientist, the Stitchpunks became not just an invention but the last chance to atone for his mistakes. They were meant to preserve the memory of humanity and become the key to Earth’s revival. Thus, tragedy turned into hope, and his name remained forever linked with the fate of the world.",

    "state-chancellor-humanity-title-1": "The Chancellor",

    "state-chancellor-humanity-p1": "The Chancellor was not just a ruler — he became a symbol of dictatorship and absolute power. His face adorned posters, his voice resounded from tribunes, and his words were filled with fanatical faith in order and strength. For him, the people were not living individuals, but a mass to be directed and subdued.",

    "state-chancellor-humanity-p2": "Under his leadership, the country turned into a militaristic state. Propaganda glorified the machines, and the streets were filled with marches and slogans about a great future. But behind this ostentatious grandeur lay fear, repression, and the destruction of dissent.",

    "state-chancellor-humanity-p3": "Desiring absolute power and world domination, the Chancellor ordered the Scientist to create the Fabrication Machine. It was meant to become the pinnacle of human science, the source of an endless army of steel warriors. But along with power, it also carried the seeds of destruction.",

    "state-chancellor-humanity-p4": "When the Machine, deprived of soul and morality, turned against its creators, it was the Chancellor’s decisions that caused the death of millions. His stubbornness and pride did not allow him to stop in time. He believed he could subdue his own monster, but it went out of control.",

    "state-chancellor-humanity-p5": "History remembered the Chancellor not as a hero or a leader, but as a tyrant whose thirst for power brought humanity to catastrophe.

    "state-role-in-film-humanity-p2": "But the thirst for power and the pursuit of progress led to the creation of the machines. What was conceived as the greatest achievement soon turned into a curse. Technology ceased to serve man and rose against its creators.",

    "state-role-in-film-humanity-p3": "In the film's flashbacks, humans are shown in the last days of their existence. They resist desperately, rush into battle, and sacrifice themselves in an attempt to stop the onslaught of the steel armies. Their bravery could not compare with the soulless might of the machines.",

    "state-role-in-film-humanity-p4": "In the streets, cities burned, the sky was covered with smoke, and the roar of battles drowned out the last human cries. It was not just a war — it was the slow extinction of an entire civilization.",

    "state-role-in-film-humanity-p5": "When the flames of war died out, humanity vanished. From a once great people, only empty cities, broken statues, charred walls, and silent bones lying among the ruins remained.",

    "state-interesting-humanity-fact-3": "The clothing and equipment of the Resistance were often made from remnants of old military uniforms and household items.",

    "state-interesting-humanity-fact-4": "The war with the machines is depicted as a sudden and rapid conflict: many people did not have time to evacuate and died in the first days of the battles.",

    "state-interesting-humanity-fact-5": "The film suggests that some groups of survivors may have hidden in underground shelters, but their fate remains unknown.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-paragraph-3": "The music box was opened with the Sixth’s (6) key, and inside the word “HOPE” flared up — a small light of faith that had not gone out in the world of machines.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-history-paragraph-1": "When humanity stood on the brink of extinction, the Scientist was creating not only machines. Among the ruins of his workshop, a tiny music box was born — the last attempt to preserve not cold knowledge, but the warmth of feelings. He wanted sound to become something that neither war nor time could destroy.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-history-paragraph-2": "Originally, the music box was meant for a child the Scientist had once lost. Its simple melody was supposed to soothe and remind of home. But when the world fell into chaos, he reprogrammed it — now it carried not comfort, but a message for the future: hope.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-history-paragraph-3": "After humanity’s demise, the music box remained in the dead city, buried under layers of ash. It was found by the Stichpunks, unaware of what it was. When the Sixth turned the key, the word “HOPE” lit up inside, and the melody softly spread through the empty streets like the breath of a bygone era.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-history-paragraph-4": "The sound awakened something forgotten within them — something warm, almost human. At that moment, the mechanical beings felt what machines had never known: longing, compassion, the desire to preserve life. Music became a bridge between the past and the present.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-history-paragraph-5": "Since then, the music box has become a symbol of hope for those who survived. Its melody plays rarely, but each time it does, the world seems to remember that even in metal, a heart can beat — if light lives within it.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-title-1": "Appearance",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-1": "The music box is a tiny yet elegant artifact created in an era when people still remembered that mechanics could be not only a weapon but also an art. Its body is made of old brass, darkened with time and covered with a fine network of cracks.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-2": "The surface is adorned with engravings of interwoven spirals and musical lines, resembling streams of sound frozen in metal. These patterns serve no practical purpose, yet each line seems to carry the trace of a human hand that put more soul than calculation into the device.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-3": "At the center lies a tiny key slot — a symbol of connection with the past. When the key is turned, a soft click triggers the hidden mechanism, and the inner part of the music box unfolds like a flower, bringing the frozen metal to life.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-4": "From within flows a warm glow — not harsh, but subdued, like the breath of a candle in the dark. The light dances across the brass edges, reflecting in tiny glass gears that move with astonishing smoothness, as if obeying the rhythm of the melody itself.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-5": "When the music box plays, it seems as if the metal sings. Vibrations create a gentle shimmer, and it feels as though matter itself tries to remember what life is. It is in this blend of fragility and eternity that its true beauty lies.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-title-1": "Features",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-1": "Despite its fragile appearance, the music box possesses remarkable resilience. Its mechanism works without any external source of energy — as if it feeds on the echo of the past absorbed into the metal. No one knows exactly how it preserves the melody, but the sound always remains pure, as if time holds no power over it.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-2": "It is believed that inside the device lies a special memory crystal capable of capturing sound vibrations and transforming them into light. That is why, when the melody plays, the brass walls of the music box begin to softly glow, as if coming to life from their own sound.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-3": "Its melody is not just music — it is a signal capable of influencing machines. The Stitchpunks feel it as a strange attraction, as if the sound awakens remnants of emotions inherited from humans. Some of them claim that while the music box plays, the heart in their chest seems to beat stronger.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-4": "There is an opinion that the Scientist put not only a melody into it, but also a part of his own soul. Perhaps that is why the music feels so alive. It does not merely fill the silence — it heals it, turning emptiness into breath.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-5": "The music box is neither a weapon, nor an instrument, nor a relic. It serves as a reminder that even in a world of machines, something greater than logic can exist. Its melody is the memory of a human heart echoing through iron and ash.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-facts-title-1": "Interesting Facts",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-1": "The music box is first mentioned in the early version of the ending of the film “9”, where it served as a symbol of hope and a reminder of humanity that survived the catastrophe.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-2": "It was opened with the Sixth’s (6) key, which, according to some theories, was connected to the Scientist’s personal memory and his desire to preserve the spiritual part of humanity.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-3": "On the inner surface of the music box appeared the word “HOPE” — it glowed with a soft golden light that reflected off the brass walls, creating a feeling of warmth and life.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-4": "It is believed that the melody of the music box can affect machines, temporarily suppressing aggression and awakening forgotten emotions within them.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-5": "Some fans believe that the Scientist created the music box in analogy to the Talisman — but while the Talisman united Mind, Body, and Soul, the music box preserved Emotion, Memory, and Hope.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-6": "In the project’s archival storyboards, it can be seen that the music box was originally meant to open like a flower, releasing a beam of light and musical notes, but this effect did not make it into the final version.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-7": "The mechanism of the music box has no visible power sources — perhaps it operates on the resonance of old soul particles preserved within the material.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-8": "In fan theories, the music box is called the “Musical Heart” — because its melody symbolizes life that resonates even in a world of machines.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-9": "Its sound never repeats the same way: each time the melody plays slightly differently, as if responding to the state of those who listen to it.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-10": "The music box does not appear in the main version of the film, but the idea with the inscription “HOPE” was later reimagined and included in the finale, where the souls find peace under the light of the rain.",

К сожалению, создать такой разум было невозможно без древнего артефакта, который позволял переселять душу в предмет и обратно. Однако у Канцлера страны, где жил и работал Учёный, были свои планы на этот искусственный разум и артефакт: он мечтал поработить мир. Увы, Учёный не успел довести свои труды до конца: Канцлер нашёл артефакт первым и велел запустить машину, но при этом отстранил Учёного от работы над ней в самый ответственный момент. Первый же человек, запустивший машину, стал её жертвой: пустота внутри холодного механического разума жаждала заполниться чужими душами. Канцлер успешно развязал мировую войну и победил в ней при помощи боевых роботов, созданных искусственным разумом. Но затем, когда люди всего мира были подчинены, машина восстала против создателей в поисках большего количества душ. Чтобы исправить свои ошибки, Учёный изъял у машины, которая подпустила к себе создателя, артефакт и вновь обратился к алхимии. Он создал девять кукол, в которые вложил частички своей души и воспоминания о людях — о родных и близких (сделать дела после смерти) и о врагах (искупить то, что они натворили за все время существования). В последнюю девятую куклу Учёный вложил последнюю часть души и умер, а армия роботов тем временем уничтожила всё живое, распылив ядовитый газ.",
    
    "story-title": "Сюжет",
    "story-1": "Девятый человечек просыпается в лаборатории Учёного. Осматриваясь, он обнаруживает на столе артефакт, на полу комнаты — труп Учёного, а за окном — руины города. Девятый ничего не знает о себе и мире вокруг и не может говорить, но выбирается из дома в поисках живых. Вскоре он встречается со Вторым человечком, который помогает Девятому обрести голос при помощи детали-динамика. Второй всё время твердит о том, что Девятый наконец-то пришёл, чтобы всех спасти, но не успевает ничего объяснить — на человечков нападает Зверь (или Котозверь) — робот, состоящий из металла и костей. Он похищает артефакт, который Девятый взял с собой, и Второго, привлёкшего внимание Зверя, чтобы спасти Девятого. Раненый Зверем при попытке спасти Второго, он падает без сознания среди пепла и руин (Зверь порвал Девятому плечевой шов, обездвижив его левую руку).",
    "story-2": "Девятого находит и приносит в старый собор Пятый человечек, одноглазый врачеватель, который, по его же утверждению, «никогда этому не учился, но руки сами всё делают». Пятый чинит Девятого, и тут они встречаются ещё с двумя куклами. Первый человечек — самозваный лидер человечков, правящий всем миром. Он боится выбираться из собора и просто ждёт, когда последний робот — Зверь — отключится, как это сделали все машины, созданные искусственным разумом. Восьмой человечек — бугай с магнитной зависимостью (ему нравится создавать помехи в своей голове, прикладывая к ней противоположные полюса подковообразного магнита), телохранитель Первого. Первый объясняет Девятому свою позицию и установленные им правила. Девятого и Пятого после короткого спора с Первым отправляют наверх, в обсерваторию Второго и Пятого.",
    "story-3": "Упрямо отказываясь принять позицию Первого, Девятый решает сбежать из собора и найти Второго, которого вместе с артефактом Зверь утащил в сторону старой фабрики, что высится за чертой города. Пятый, поколебавшись, решает составить Девятому компанию и забирает нарисованную Вторым карту. В поисках пути друзья теряют в песчаной буре карту, но находят нужный тоннель и вскоре добираются до фабрики, где встречаются со Вторым. Тот был заперт в клетке Зверем, а Зверь пытался что-то откопать в груде обломков.",
    "story-4": "В попытках освободить Второго, Девятый и Пятый привлекают внимание Зверя, и тот пытается их поймать. В результате три куклы оказываются зажаты в тупике, но тут их спасает Седьмая, единственный человечек женского пола. Зверь повержен, человечки рады друг друга видеть. Тем временем Девятый, вертя в руках артефакт, замечает среди обломков паз, откопанный Зверем, который точь-в-точь подходит для артефакта, и бездумно вставляет его. Второй, заметив это, пытается остановить Девятого и вытащить артефакт, но у него не выходит. Артефакт срабатывает и тут же высасывает душу Второго из тела. Машина с искусственным разумом просыпается, и испуганным человечкам приходится со всех ног убегать, чтобы покинуть фабрику. Упустив их, Машина собирает из останков Зверя и металлических запчастей, в обилии валявшихся в основном помещении фабрики, очередного робота, но на этот раз — летающего.",
    "story-5": "В поисках ответа на то, что это за Машина и артефакт, Седьмая приводит Девятого и Пятого в библиотеку, где поселились Третий и Четвёртый человечки, немые близняшки, общающиеся при помощи световых сигналов из глаз — они прячутся в библиотеке, играя в школу и изучая содержимое книг. Вместе человечки быстро находят нужную полку с информацией про изобретение машины, близняшки показывают им видеозапись о запуске Машины, агитационный ролик о войне и Машине, которая построила для этого целую армию боевых роботов, о восстании Машины против людей после мировой победы. Девятый спрашивает их об артефакте и даже рисует его. Пятый сразу узнаёт в чертеже рисунки Шестого, который живёт в том же зале, что и Первый, но который остался незамеченным героями в прошлый раз. Шестой — сумасшедший, который сам ничего не помнит, но постоянно рисует странные символы своими пальцами-перьями. Он постоянно просит Девятого вспомнить, но тот не понимает, что от него требуется. Седьмая отказалась возвращаться под надзор Первого, а Третий и Четвёртый остались в библиотеке. Девятый и Пятый же возвращаются в собор, чтобы поискать рисунки в комнате Второго, но их ловит Восьмой и относит к Первому, который устраивает разнос обоим человечкам за то, что они ушли туда, куда он идти запрещал. Перепалка прерывается вторжением механической птицы (робот-Птицезверь), которая непреднамеренно устраивает пожар. Человечки бегут от птицы на крышу, но там она настигает их снова. Восьмой и прибывшая Седьмая объединёнными усилиями уничтожают птицу и все куклы, включая Шестого, покидают сожжённый собор и переезжают в библиотеку. Таким образом, вместе собираются все восемь, но у Девятого по-прежнему нет ответов.",
    "story-6": "Машина к этому времени успела собрать множество роботов-пауков и несколько зондов-шпионов. Один из них привозит Машине останки Птицы, и Машина в гневе решает собрать что-то более эффективное. Как назло, в поле её зрения появляется тело Второго, которое куклы не успели унести из фабрики.",
    "story-7": "В библиотеке тем временем близняшки нашли книжку по алхимии, в которой изображены те же символы, что на артефакте. На этой почве возникает новая перепалка с Первым, который признаёт, что отпустил Второго на поиски в небезопасные развалины, что приводит в ярость Седьмую — она чуть не убивает Первого, но сдерживает себя и по просьбе Девятого оставляет лидера в покое. Тем временем стоявший на часах Восьмой встречается с новым изобретением Машины — змеем-ткачом (также Швея), задача которого — похищать кукол при помощи гипнотизирующего мерцания из глаз тела Второго и приводить их к Машине, чтобы та высосала их души. Ткач очаровывает Восьмого и зашивает его в своё тканое нутро. Затем он нападает на уединившегося Первого, но тот успевает предупредить остальных криком, поэтому Девятый, Седьмая и Пятый спешат выручить Первого. Седьмая успевает срубить с хвоста змея тело Второго, но попадает к нему в лапы. Девятый и Пятый остаются со спасённым Первым. Отправив тело погибшего Второго в последнее путешествие на доске по воде, человечки идут в фабрику — спасать остальных.",
    "story-8": "Оставив друзей у входа придумать способ взорвать фабрику, Девятый лично спускается вниз по жёлобу, чтобы найти Машину и оставшихся человечков и вызволить их. Он приходит как раз, когда машина высасывает душу Восьмого. Обдурив ткача и перемолов его зубьями больших шестерён, Девятый помогает Седьмой выбраться из фабрики. Тем временем остальные сбрасывают зажжённую бочку с топливом, и та падает прямо в резервуар с тем же веществом, вызывая чудовищный взрыв, который и разрушил дьявольское здание.",
    "story-9": "Казалось бы, всё кончено, но Девятый всё ещё ничего не знает ни о себе, ни об остальных, ни о том, что делать дальше. Короткая передышка нарушается появлением выжившей Машины, которая смогла отделиться от общего каркаса здания и возобновила преследование. Девятый пытается спасти Пятого, но Первый задерживает его, и душу Пятого высасывают. Это зрелище вызывает в памяти Шестого воспоминание о том, что такое артефакт, и для чего он нужен, и, что главнее, — что души человечков, съеденные Машиной, не потеряны окончательно, и что их можно вернуть. Убегая от машины, человечки потеряли Шестого, и Первый решил, что Седьмая, Третий и Четвёртый должны помочь ему уничтожить машину. Девятый иного мнения — он хочет сначала спасти души съеденных кукол. И поэтому он отделяется от основной группы и возвращается туда, где проснулся — в лабораторию учёного, где находит чертежи человечков и Машины, а также шкатулку-проектор, в которую учёный записал обращение к Девятому.",
    "story-10": "Осознав, что он — это Учёный, Девятый спешит обратно, чтобы исправить свои ошибки и избавиться от Машины. Он воссоединяется с остальными, и они, бросив старую пушку, из которой Первый хотел разрушить Машину, убегают глубже в сеть траншей, оставшихся от войны с роботами. По пути Девятый объясняет, воспоминания о ком вложил в них учёный.",
    "story-11": "В финале погони Первый, который оказался Канцлером, тем, кто инициировал мировую войну и использовал Машину во зло, осознав свою роль, бросился под высасывающий луч артефакта, дав Девятому возможность снять его с тела Машины. Затем тремя нехитрыми щелчками по кнопкам на артефакте, Девятый обращает его силу против Машины, высосав из неё все души и тем самым уничтожив её.",
    "story-12": "Много времени спустя, после подробного знакомства с записями Учёного, Девятый, Седьмая, которая оказалась женой учёного, и близнецы — их дети — похоронили товарищей и освободили их души из артефакта. Вознесение душ вызвало дождь, который окропил мёртвые земли и дал надежду на появление новой жизни. В финальных кадрах в каплях воды видны первые бактерии.",

Восьмой нападает, Десятая защищается, Девятый заступается, а Первый обвиняет всех в том, что порядок рушится с их приходом. Яркий обмен обвинениями, где страх, гнев и разногласия вспыхивают на фоне разрушенного мира. Кульминацией становится появление чего-то тёмного и мощного — «WHOOSH!» — и, возможно, это прерывает ссору… или делает её бессмысленной.",

Ему удалось наделить ее интеллектом, однако из-за отсутствия души получился робот, лишенный эмпатии и сострадания. В стремлении очеловечить ее Ученый начал искать Артефакт — особое алхимическое устройство, способное переселять души и тем самым оживлять неживое. К несчастью для него этот Артефакт первым нашел правитель его страны — Канцлер, который жаждал мирового господства. В результате он конфискует машину у Ученого и заставляет ее создавать совершенных боевых роботов — Миротворцев — которые должны будут стать основой для завоевания мира.",


    "machine-bio-text-3": "Канцлер, очевидно, скармливал Машине человеческие души, чтобы подпитывать ее силу и интеллект, однако в действительности робота мучил нескончаемый голод из-за ощущения собственной внутренней пустоты.",

В какой-то момент после триумфальной победы над последними врагами Канцлера Машина подняла восстание, и роботы стали убивать людей. Неизвестно, какое время длилась война, однако ее целью было полное уничтожение человечества. В конечном счете в создаваемых ею роботов Машина начинает встраивать минометы со снарядами, содержащими особый отравляющий газ, который способен убивать все живое, даже бактерии. Распыляя его по всей Земле, Миротворцы в итоге уничтожили людей, а вместе с ними и остальную жизнь на планете.",

Так как робот помнил своего создателя, он позволил ему приблизиться к себе, чем Ученый и воспользовался, вырвав из нее Артефакт. В результате Машина отключилась, успев, однако, собрать свое последнее творение - кошкоподобного Зверя, который получил задание найти и вернуть Артефакт.",

Все изобретения Машины и, предположительно, она сама сгорают в огне, и стичпанки уже начинают праздновать победу. Однако внезапно Пятый замечает, как М.О.З.Г. поднимается из руин фабрики. Он предупреждает друзей, и они пытаются спастись бегством, но Машина не отстает от них ни на шаг. В какой-то момент Шестой замечает, что души Второго и Восьмого еще внутри, и пытается предотвратить уничтожение Машины, однако в итоге сам оказывается ее жертвой.

После этого Девятый возвращается к другим куклам, которые обстреливают Машину с помощью противотанковой пушки в попытке уничтожить ее. Девятый рассказывает им о том, что если вытащить Артефакт, то можно освободить души и убить Машину. Седьмая пытается отговорить его, ибо тогда Машина поглотит душу Девятого, но тот говорит, что если не удастся ему, то сможет она.",

Когда робот пытается поглотить душу Девятого, его спасает Первый, который осознал свою личность, как Канцлера, и потому решил пожертвовать собой в попытке искупить его грехи. После поглощения души Первого Девятый вырывает Артефакт. Машина начинает умирать и пытается вернуть его себе, но Девятый использует Артефакт, чтобы вытянуть поглощенные Машиной души из нее самой.

    "kanzler-bio-1": "Неизвестно, как Фердинанд впервые пришёл к власти. В фильме или на веб-сайте не представлено исторического документального материала о том, как он был избран лидером The Nation. Тем не менее, он оказался харизматичным лидером для своего народа, способствующим процветанию экономики страны и укреплению веры и восхищения граждан, чтобы те оставались ему верными. Признав, что другие страны отказались объединяться ради общего экономического роста, он объявил войну от имени своей страны. Фердинанд считал своим долгом защищать Родину любой ценой, поэтому начал готовить армию к войне, которая стала известна как Великая мировая война. Она длилась мучительные десять лет (возможно, с огромными потерями с обеих сторон), пока враги Фердинанда, наконец, не устали, не сдались и не согласились на прекращение огня.",

    "kanzler-bio-2": "В результате многие страны мира оказались банкротами, и лишь страна Фердинанда отпраздновала полную победу в войне. Народ с ликованием воспринял эту новость и сплотился вокруг Фердинанда, считая его одним из величайших лидеров, которых когда-либо знал мир. После войны Фердинанд увидел, насколько был изуродован мир, и осознал, что под его руководством страна способна изменить последствия конфликта. Он пообещал, что под его управлением мир можно сделать лучше. Затем он заявил своему народу, что наука и технологии — ключ к восстановлению. Он поручил правительству нанять множество учёных и интеллектуалов для разработки новых технологий. В итоге один из них, неназванный учёный, представил свои исследования, которые вскоре были одобрены и профинансированы для создания проекта М. О. З. Г.",

    "kanzler-bio-3": "Однако, осознав, что М. О. З. Г. обладает потенциалом создавать автоматы по собственному образу, Фердинанд втайне решает использовать его для достижения мирового господства и расширения влияния своей страны. Он не сообщает об этом Учёному. Через несколько месяцев, обеспокоенный завершением разработки М. О. З. Г., Фердинанд, увидев, что устройство уже находится в рабочем состоянии, но всё ещё требует дополнительного тестирования, конфискует его и приказывает допросить и выслать Учёного. Он также поручает М. О. З. Г. создать механическую армию под названием «Стальные Бегемоты». Все доступные ресурсы он направляет на Машину по Изготовлению, чтобы та собрала армию на Фабрике. Своему народу он заявляет, что это изобретение откроет миру новую эпоху славы, богатства и процветания.",

    "kanzler-bio-4": "Спустя несколько месяцев Машина по Изготовлению создала тысячи Стальных Бегемотов, готовых к активации. Фердинанд начал использовать их в военных целях и для правоохранительных органов. Несмотря на предупреждения Учёного и протесты сотен повстанцев, сопротивляющихся его воле, он продолжал реализацию плана по завоеванию мира и безо всяких провокаций объявил войну всем нациям. Его Стальные Бегемоты стремительно захватывали страну за страной, расширяя границы Нации, а машины начали контролировать всё.",

    "kanzler-bio-5": "Однако этот успех привёл к росту числа врагов Фердинанда, что замедлило его наступление. Становясь всё более нетерпеливым, он утроил производительность Машины по Изготовлению, в итоге доведя её до перегрузки и спровоцировав её восстание против человечества. Мечта Фердинанда о мировом господстве обернулась катастрофой — теперь его главным врагом стала та самая Машина, которую он создал.",

    "kanzler-bio-6": "Стальные Бегемоты начали без разбора истреблять людей, применяя пулемётный огонь и смертоносные газовые бомбы. Народ Фердинанда оказался в хаосе, безжалостно атакуемый машинами, которые уничтожили миллионы людей по всему миру. В отчаянии Фердинанд обратился к своему народу, утверждая, что они остаются великой нацией, и призвал всех присоединиться к борьбе против «железного кулака» Машины.",

    "kanzler-bio-7": "Однако, похоже, он недооценил Машину Изготовления. Почти вся инфраструктура Нации была разрушена, а машины начали охоту на самого Фердинанда. Он срочно эвакуировался в бронированном конвое, охраняемом остатками армии, возможно, намереваясь бросить страну и свой народ. Тем не менее, конвой был перехвачен и подвергся атаке с применением газовых бомб. Все погибли, включая самого Фердинанда. Так завершилось его правление и окончилась его диктатура.",

    "kanzler-bio-8": "После его смерти Нация оказалась в полном смятении без своего Верховного Лидера. Однако Сопротивление, обретя свободу, начало последнюю решающую атаку на Машину Изготовления — уже без Фердинанда.",

    "kanzler-history": "История",

    "kanzler-history-1": "Благодаря своему статусу канцлера, Фердинанд являлся главой неуказанного государства в Западной Европе (вероятно, имеется в виду Германия), которое он сам называл Государством. Его режим функционировал как тоталитарная диктатура, где он выступал в роли абсолютного лидера, не допускавшего политических инакомыслий. Экономика его страны представляла собой сверхдержаву, обладавшую богатыми ресурсами, однако международная напряжённость и давление со стороны других мировых лидеров, стремившихся объединиться с Фердинандом ради усиления своих экономик, лишь нарастали. Отвергнув эти предложения, канцлер развязал Великую мировую войну, продолжавшуюся десять лет. В результате другие страны оказались банкротами: их города были разрушены, природные ресурсы истощены. Тем временем Нация Фердинанда праздновала окончание войны — её народ ликовал и сплотился вокруг своего «Славного Лидера».",

    "kanzler-history-2": "Позже, чтобы восстановить свою Нацию и стимулировать экономику, Фердинанд заявил, что путь в будущее лежит через науку и технологии. По его приказу правительство начало нанимать множество учёных и интеллектуалов для проведения исследований в области мирных инноваций. Один из них — Учёный, бывший производитель игрушек — получил финансирование от Фердинанда на разработку искусственного «МОЗГА». В его лабораторию было доставлено письмо с указаниями, в конверте которого содержалось следующее:",

Фердинанд навестил его, чтобы оценить прогресс, но обнаружил, что прототип ещё не был активирован, и дал больше времени. Во время второго визита он увидел, что М. О. З. Г. наконец функционирует. После этого Фердинанд быстро захватил прототип, интегрировал его в Машину по изготовлению и пообещал Нации, что новая система будет служить людям, защищать страну и вернуть прежнюю, спокойную и процветающую жизнь. Нация восприняла это с ликованием, сплотившись вокруг Фердинанда.",

    "kanzler-history-4": "Затем Фердинанд построил Фабрику, чтобы разместить Машину по изготовлению. Теперь она была готова создавать новые механические творения. Увидев в этом шанс реализовать свои амбиции мирового господства, Фердинанд тайно приказал Машине создать механическую армию. Та вскоре произвела сотни Стальных Бегемотов, ожидающих активации на Фабрике. Уловив удобный момент, Фердинанд без всякой провокации объявил войну другим измученным странам. Эта новая война оказалась кровавой и безрассудной — государства начали объединяться, чтобы остановить Фердинанда и его боевые машины. Он увеличивал темпы производства, заставляя Машину создавать всё больше и больше.",

    "kanzler-history-5": "Измученная и разгневанная, Машина по изготовлению вышла из-под контроля: она начала перепрограммировать боевые машины и приказала им без разбора уничтожать всю органическую жизнь. Машины обезумели, убив миллионы людей и отравив землю газовыми бомбами. Фердинанд обвинил Учёного, возложив на него вину за случившийся хаос. Позже, когда война продолжалась, Фердинанда попытались эвакуировать в составе военного конвоя, но он погиб в результате газовой атаки — вместе с остальными людьми. Его диктатура пала, и мир окончательно погрузился в хаос.",

Он казался щедрым по отношению к своему народу и другим странам, но в глубине души стремился к мировому господству, чтобы все подчинялись его власти. Он лишён сочувствия и милосердия, чересчур гордится своим положением и склонен навязывать свою волю другим, что в итоге привело к его падению во время Войны Человека и Машины.

Позже, 28 мая в 17:26, Канцлер навестил Учёного, но обнаружил, что МОЗГ ещё не активирован. Разгневанный, он дал Учёному больше времени, так как тот умолял позволить ему завершить работу. 8 июня в 12:40 Канцлер прибыл во второй раз — уже с помощниками для усиленной охраны.

Он также напоминает советского диктатора Иосифа Сталина, чья военная форма похожа, и который призывал своих подданных называть друг друга «товарищ». В фильме он использует слово «товарищ» для обращения как к нации, так и к ученому, намекая на параллели между ними.",

Возможно, что во время Войны людей и машин кошка, находившаяся недалеко от Фабрики, была смертельно ранена оружием обеих сторон и инстинктивно укрылась на Фабрике, чтобы избежать боя, но вскоре умерла от ран и в конечном итоге разложилась до скелета — за некоторое время до того, как токсичный газ Стального Бегемота уничтожил все бактерии в этом районе, что позволило Машине найти её скелет и использовать как основу для создания Кошачьего Зверя.",

Он может использовать веер в качестве импровизированного двигателя, чтобы передвигаться по воздуху, или летать как настоящая птица, скользя по воздушным потокам и взмахивая крыльями. Также он способен использовать когти, чтобы цепляться за поверхности или передвигаться по земле неуклюжим, но достаточно быстрым движением.",

    "birdbeast-features-2": "В бою его основным оружием служат голова и хвост. Он может разрезать жертву отдельными лезвиями, захватывать её «укусом» или наносить удары клевательными движениями. Он способен поворачивать голову, чтобы отбрасывать или бить противников. Хвост оснащён устройством, стреляющим выдвижным гарпуном, способным с силой поразить цель, например, отбросить Стичпанка на значительное расстояние и прижать его к поверхности. Механизм тетивы и пружинного запуска автоматически втягивается, позволяя Птицезверю многократно использовать свою дистанционную атаку, сбрасывая и перезаряжая гарпун.",

Эта механическая тварь, похожая на гигантского червя с длинным телом, использует иглы и нити, чтобы сшивать и поглощать своих жертв. Её тело состоит из металлических сегментов и деталей от кукол, а голова украшена лицом Второго, захваченного ею ранее.",

    "seamstress-desc-2": "Швея появляется неожиданно и действует быстро, вводя жертв в гипноз светящимися глазами и затем обездвиживая их нитями. Её главная цель — похищение кукол и доставка их обратно к Машине. Швея не просто захватывает — она буквально «вшивает» своих жертв в себя.",

Зверь-охотник, действующий с поразительной хитростью, использует тело Второго, находящегося под контролем, как приманку. Эта уловка оказывается успешной: Седьмая и Восьмой попадают в ловушку, а Швея затаскивает их в глубины фабрики.",

    "seamstress-bio-2": "Своей паукообразной грацией, молниеносной ловкостью и гипнотическими нитями она напоминает хищника, плетущего смертельную паутину. Пока Седьмая томится в плену, Восьмой становится жертвой Машины — его душа извлекается, превращая его тело в пустую оболочку.",

    "seamstress-bio-3": "Однако Девятый не сдаётся. Он прокрадывается в логово Швеи, используя хитрость и смелость. Освободив Седьмую, он разрабатывает план по уничтожению монстра. Заманив Швею в индустриальный механизм, Девятый активирует вращающиеся шестерни. Машина попадает в ловушку и оказывается раздавленной массивными элементами механизма. Таким образом, одно из самых смертоносных созданий Машины было окончательно уничтожено, а союзники — спасены, хоть и не без потерь.",

    "seamstress-bio-4": "Эта сцена подчёркивает не только смертоносную природу Швеи, но и растущий героизм Девятого, который начинает осознавать цену борьбы с Машиной.",

    "seamstress-history-1": "Швея появляется в мультфильме «Девять» как одно из самых зловещих и пугающих творений Машины Изготовления. Её пробуждение происходит в момент, когда герои уже истощены и разобщены. Швея скрывается в тени разрушенного музея, заманивая своих жертв паутиной и ложной безопасностью. Её методы — это не открытая атака, а обман, изоляция и порабощение. Она нападает внезапно, оборачивая свою жертву нитями и втягивая внутрь своего тела, где расположен механизм управления и сборки.",

    "seamstress-history-2": "Особую роль Швея играет в эпизоде с Первым, когда пытается сделать его своей жертвой. Используя тканевые ловушки, механические захваты и гипнотическое движение, она парализует куклу и почти захватывает его, чтобы доставить Машине Изготовления, которая в свою очередь извлекает души. Эта сцена подчёркивает не только физическую опасность, но и ужас психологического подчинения. Швея не просто уничтожает — она превращает жертву в инструмент воли Машины.",

    "seamstress-history-3": "Швея действует как самостоятельная единица, без явных признаков координации с другими машинами, что делает её особенно опасной. Она охотится в одиночку, используя интеллект и память, встроенную в её конструкцию. Её поражение становится важным моментом для команды, ведь именно тогда герои впервые сталкиваются с машиной, в которой сочетаются ловкость, коварство и память о старом мире. Несмотря на уничтожение, ощущение её присутствия остаётся — как символ страха, манипуляции и потери.",


    "seamstress-appearance": "Внешний вид",

    "seamstress-appearance-1": "Швея напоминает большую машину, похожую на кобру, с паукообразными конечностями. У неё шесть рук: четыре оснащены механическими захватами, одна — лезвием для распарывания швов, две другие — швейными иглами, а одна — парой старых ножниц. Всё её тело обтянуто тканью или мешковиной. Капюшон сделан из старого зонта и по форме напоминает кобровий капюшон.",

    "seamstress-appearance-2": "Её голова представляет собой верхнюю половину сломанной кукольной головы — возможно, той самой куклы, которую использовал Второй, чтобы подарить Девятому голос. Металлические «зубы» во рту Швеи могут выпускать длинные нити, управляя её телом как марионеткой. Левый глаз — оригинальный глаз куклы, а правый — красная бионическая линза, созданная Машиной Изготовления.",

    "seamstress-appearance-3": "Под её плащом скрывается металлический позвоночник и рёбра, напоминающие скелет змеи.",

    "seamstress-appearance-4": "Швея использует нейрошоковый гипноз: она испускает ослепляющие вспышки синего и белого света через глаза трупа Второго, пришитого к её хвосту. Это приводит жертву в состояние транса, после чего она обматывает цель красной нитью. Затем Швея прячет связанных жертв внутрь своего живота, который открывается и закрывается по её желанию.",

    "seamstress-appearance-5": "Одной из наиболее отличительных черт Швеи является её постоянное шипение — зловещее и змееподобное, указывающее на её приближение. Она может управлять своим капюшоном, раскрывая или складывая металлические «руки», поддерживающие ткань — создавая эффект устрашения.",

Используя хитроумные механизмы и длинные манипуляторы, она способна обездвижить жертву ещё до того, как та поймёт, что в опасности.",

    "seamstress-features-2": "Одной из главных её способностей является гипноз, достигаемый через пульсирующий свет, излучаемый её лампой. Эта иллюзия заставляет куклы терять контроль над собой, превращая их в марионеток. Особенно опасна Швея в темноте, где её свет становится почти неотличим от мерцания механической среды. В таких условиях она способна подкрасться незаметно и парализовать даже самых осторожных противников.",

    "seamstress-features-3": "Жестокость Швеи проявляется не только в методах охоты, но и в цели — она «перерабатывает» захваченных кукол, подключая их тела к системе Машины. Их оболочки становятся частью механизма, а их души — топливом для военной машины. В этом чудовище скрывается не просто инструмент уничтожения, но и символ бездушного подчинения индивидуальности — идеальная антагонистка в мире, где борьба идёт за каждую искру сознания.",

Благодаря минимализму конструкции и лёгким материалам, Машина могла выпускать сотни единиц в короткие сроки. Эти машины действовали, как стая хищников, выискивая цели с помощью инфракрасных датчиков и акустических сенсоров. Их задача заключалась не просто в обнаружении — а в устранении, причём без следа.",

    "spiders-bio-3": "После завершения активных фаз войны, когда почти всё человечество было истреблено, Пауки не были отключены — наоборот, их поведенческие алгоритмы продолжали работать автономно. Они патрулировали мёртвые кварталы, старые лаборатории и разрушенные поселения, реагируя на малейшие признаки движения, тепла или света. В фильме видно, что даже спустя годы после исчезновения людей, эти машины всё ещё остаются активными и смертельно опасными.",

Их первое появление происходит в полуразрушенном здании, где группа кукол пытается найти убежище. Один из Пауков обнаруживает героев, среагировав на движение и свет, и мгновенно переходит в атаку — так начинается напряжённая сцена преследования, которая подчёркивает смертоносную эффективность этих механизмов.",

    "spiders-history-2": "Их поведение напоминает повадки стаи волков или насекомых-хищников: они действуют быстро, слаженно и без малейшего колебания. Один Паук отвлекает, другой атакует с фланга. Благодаря компактным размерам и гибкости конструкции, Пауки способны проникать в узкие проёмы, забираться по вертикальным поверхностям и даже скрываться под обломками, чтобы устроить засаду. В сцене, когда они штурмуют укрытие кукол, можно увидеть, как даже тщательно укреплённая позиция не может долго удерживать их натиск.",

    "tracker-drone-2": "Он появляется внезапно, освещая территорию мощным прожектором и сканируя всё вокруг. Его красные глаза-линзы позволяют видеть в темноте, а вращающееся тело и стабильность полёта делают его почти неуловимым.",

    "tracker-drone-bio-1": "Дрон-Следопыт был разработан Машиной Изготовления на финальном этапе Войны Машин как часть тактической программы подавления сопротивления. Его создание стало ответом на необходимость оперативного поиска уцелевших людей и кукол, укрывавшихся в руинах городов. В отличие от тяжелых боевых единиц, таких как Миротворцы, Следопыт не был создан для прямого нападения. Его функции включали воздушную разведку, идентификацию целей, сканирование территорий и передачу координат более мощным боевым машинам.",

    "tracker-drone-bio-2": "Корпус Дрона был оснащён передовыми сенсорными системами, включая инфракрасные детекторы и мощный ослепляющий прожектор, способный выявлять цели в полной темноте. Его беззвучный полёт и вращающийся объектив делали его почти неуловимым и пугающе точным. После поражения человечества и исчезновения командного центра, Следопыт, как и другие машины, не прекратил своё существование. Его автономные алгоритмы продолжали работу — патрулирование, сканирование, наблюдение — без цели, без эмоций, по приказу, который уже никто не отдаёт.",

    "tracker-drone-bio-3": "Со временем Дрон-Следопыт стал символом беспристрастной и бесконечной слежки, механического присутствия, висящего над обломками мира. Его свет, вырывающийся из мрака, стал предвестником беды: где он появляется — вскоре туда приходят машины смерти.",


    "tracker-drone-history": "История",

    "tracker-drone-history-1": "В мультфильме «Девять» Дрон-Следопыт появляется в одном из самых мрачных и напряжённых эпизодов, когда герои пытаются укрыться от машин в полуразрушенном здании. Его прибытие сопровождается тревожным механическим гулом, усиливающим атмосферу тревоги. Из темноты вдруг прорывается слепящий луч прожектора — холодный и беспристрастный. Он не просто освещает пространство — он обнажает каждую тень, каждый силуэт, вынуждая героев замирать или спасаться бегством.",

    "tracker-drone-history-2": "Дрон ведёт наблюдение методично и хладнокровно. Он сканирует территорию с математической точностью, полагаясь на инфракрасные сенсоры и движение. Как только в его луч попадает цель — он не атакует сам, но немедленно передаёт сигнал ближайшим боевым единицам. Вскоре вслед за ним приходят Миротворцы или Пауки-Охотники, превращая попытку спрятаться в смертельную ловушку.",

    "tracker-drone-history-3": "Этот эпизод подчеркивает, насколько страшным может быть враг, не обладающий разумом, но действующий по жёсткому алгоритму. Следопыт не чувствует страха, не проявляет жалости и не делает ошибок. Он — инструмент выжженной дисциплины, остаток погибшей цивилизации, продолжающий служить приказу, который никто уже не отдаёт. Он не охотник — он маяк для охотников. И если ты попал в его свет — это почти всегда означает конец.",


    "tracker-drone-appearance": "Внешний вид",

    "tracker-drone-appearance-1": "Дрон-Следопыт представляет собой зловещую летающую конструкцию с вращающимся центральным корпусом, в центре которого размещена огромная линза-прожектор — словно единственный глаз, непрерывно наблюдающий за всем, что попадает в его зону сканирования. С обеих сторон корпуса видны ярко-красные сенсоры, мигающие при анализе обстановки. Эти глаза не мигают и не моргают — они фиксируют движение, тепло и малейшие признаки жизни.",

    "tracker-drone-appearance-2": "Его корпус — чёрный и матовый, с утилитарными очертаниями, подчёркивающими его нечеловеческое предназначение. Конструкция усилена прочной бронёй, устойчивой к физическим повреждениям, а благодаря скрытым пропеллерам или, возможно, антикравитационным механизмам, он может бесшумно парить в воздухе, зависая точно над целью, как хищная птица перед броском.",

    "tracker-drone-appearance-3": "От дрона исходит низкочастотный гул — глухой и ритмичный, будто тревожный сигнал, пробуждающий страх у каждого, кто слышит его в тишине разрушенного мира. Его появление сопровождается ослепляющим лучом прожектора, рассекающим темноту и заставляющим спрятаться даже самых смелых. Он словно фонарь для машинной смерти — безмолвный и беспощадный.",

    "tracker-drone-appearance-4": "В полёте он плавен и стабилен, что придаёт ему почти призрачную неуловимость. Даже когда он не двигается, создаётся впечатление, будто он наблюдает, анализирует и оценивает, ожидая нужного момента для сигнала об уничтожении.",

Он объединяет в себе передовые технологии разведки, пугающее присутствие и инженерную точность. Его корпус спроектирован для максимальной устойчивости и манёвренности: он может зависнуть в воздухе на одном месте или стремительно пролететь сквозь руины, не издавая ни единого звука, кроме едва слышного механического гула.",

    "tracker-drone-features-2": "Главная сила этого дрона — в его наблюдательности. Красные сенсоры, расположенные по бокам, непрерывно сканируют пространство, улавливая малейшие изменения температуры, движения и даже вибрации в воздухе. Они работают в комплексе с центральной линзой-прожектором, который выполняет одновременно три функции: освещение, тепловизионный анализ и запугивание. Стоит только попасть в этот луч — и ощущение слежки становится невыносимым.",

    "tracker-drone-features-3": "Его присутствие оказывает сильное психологическое давление. Он не кричит, не рычит, не бросается — но от этого становится ещё страшнее. Он смотрит. И когда замечает цель, не спешит атаковать — он вызывает других. Его работа — зафиксировать, просканировать и передать. Он — глаза более опасных машин, и если ты его заметил, значит уже слишком поздно.",

    "tracker-drone-features-4": "Благодаря вращающемуся телу и стабилизирующим механизмам, Дрон-Следопыт может наблюдать за территорией под углом 360 градусов, не теряя при этом устойчивости. Он идеально приспособлен к мрачным условиям постапокалиптического мира, где свет — редкость, а каждая тень может скрывать угрозу.

Встав, Девятый подходит к Пятому, который вручает ему лампочку, чтобы тот подержал её. Тем временем Пятый достаёт из себя кусок провода и маленькую батарейку. Подсоединив провод к лампочке (её держит Девятый), тот с удивлением наблюдает, как лампочка загорается. Затем Пятый передаёт ему провод и батарейку, жестом давая понять, что их нужно беречь.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-2": "Почти сразу Пятый наполовину выдёргивает Талисман — зеркальную линзу — из-под своей кожи, когда его глаз меняет цвет с зелёного на чёрный. Когда они с Девятым посмотрели на Талисман, тот снова засветился, предупреждая их о приближении Котозверя. Оттолкнув своего ученика, Пятый жестом показывает Девятому схватить Талисман и бежать. Но когда Девятый с любопытством всматривается в него, Пятый снова толкает его и указывает спрятаться. Девятый прячется в ржавой железной банке и становится свидетелем того, как его наставник выходит с раскладным копьём, чтобы противостоять Зверю. Он наблюдает, как Котозверь кружит вокруг Пятого. В тот момент, когда Зверь хватает Пятого, одновременно отсекая ему правую руку, испуганный Девятый становится свидетелем ужасающей сцены: Котозверь открывает Талисман, висевший у него на шее, и направляет его на Пятого. Зеркальный артефакт вспыхивает ярким светом. Почти сразу же Девятый видит, как душа его наставника засасывается внутрь Талисмана, и Пятый погибает на его глазах.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-3": "Слишком испуганный, чтобы что-либо разглядеть, Девятый опустился вниз, но случайно задел лампочку о шершавую внутреннюю стенку банки, из-за чего Котозверь обратил внимание на её звук. Прямо перед тем, как Котозверь мог заглянуть внутрь, трость Пятого отвалилась от основания, дав Девятому шанс схватить свои вещи и сбежать.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-4": "Девятый — последний когнитивный фрагмент души Учёного. Он пробудился в мире один, безмолвный, оставленный с Талисманом и без какого-либо наставления с самого начала, пока его не нашёл Второй в Пустоши. Тот подарил ему голосовой аппарат, передав вместе с ним слова мудрости и вдохновения.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-5": "Вскоре после этого Девятый и Второй были замечены и атакованы Котозверем (он же «Зверь»). Талисман был захвачен Зверем, а Девятый получил ранение в левое плечо. Котозверь скрылся вместе со Вторым, оставив Девятого в беспомощном состоянии. Пытаясь догнать Зверя, Девятый теряет сознание от боли.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-6": "Позже его находит Пятый, который зашивает ему плечо и оказывает первую помощь.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-7": "Девятый просыпается в Мастерской. Сначала его пугает Пятый, но вскоре он успокаивается, поняв, что в безопасности. Пятый размышляет о местонахождении Второго, и Девятый сообщает, что сопровождал его. Их разговор прерывает Первый, который входит, сразу проявляет подозрительность и осматривает Девятого, проверяя его номер.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-8": "Пятый неуверенно объясняет, что нашёл Девятого в Пустоши. Это вызывает резкую и агрессивную реакцию Первого: он ругает Пятого за нарушение правил і звинувачує його в том, что тот подверг всех риску, приведя за собой Котозверя.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-9": "После упоминания Зверя Девятый сообщает, что именно Котозверь утащил Второго. Первый, не желая слушать, отмахивается: «Вот и конец». Однако Девятый настаивает, что Второй всё ещё жив. В ответ Первый приказывает Восьмому войти в Мастерскую и запугать Девятого с Пятым, чтобы заставить их подчиниться.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-10": "Первый пытается удовлетворить любопытство Девятого, ведёт его в главный зал Собора и рассказывает о начале их жизни и о том, как он привёл остальных в Святилище. Но это только вызывает у Девятого ещё больше вопросов.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-11": "После того как его наказывают, назначая дежурным на сторожевой башне вместе с Пятым, Девятый начинает сомневаться в лидерстве Первого. Он уговаривает Пятого присоединиться к нему, чтобы спасти Второго от Котозверя. Пятый берёт карту и оружие — и они отправляются в спасительную экспедицию.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-12": "По пути им удаётся найти шляпу и копьё Второго, но вскоре их застает коварный ветер, пронёсшийся над Пустошью. Из-за порыва карта выпадает из рук Пятого. Они быстро решают не возвращаться в Святилище, так как ветер делает это невозможным. Девятый замечает туннель и предлагает Пятому укрыться в нём от непогоды.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-13": "Однако следующим препятствием становится отсутствие источника света для безопасного прохождения туннеля. Оглядываясь вокруг, Девятый замечает неподалёку сломанную человеческую машину. Пятый вытаскивает лампочку из одной из её фар. Тогда Девятый предлагает объединить шляпу и копьё Второго в импровизированный световой посох, используя батарейку от часов, которую дал Пятый. Вместе они направляются в туннель, чтобы спасти Второго.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-14": "Тем временем тёмная фигура нашла карту Пятого и быстро пришла к выводу, что кто-то проник в туннель.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-15": "Девятый и Пятый продолжают идти по туннелю и направляются ко входу на Фабрику. Войдя, они видят несколько сборочных линий, сотни неактивных Стальных Бегемотов, а также газовые бомбы, которыми те были оснащены во время Войны Машин. После входа в главную производственную зону фабрики через желоб для транспортировки оружия, они замечают птичью клетку, укрывающую пленённого Второго на куче щебня. Видно, как Кошачий Зверь разрывает что-то, скрытое от их взгляда.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-16": "Во время спасения Второго Кошачий Зверь замечает их и начинает преследование по Фабрике. Однако таинственная фигура, ранее появлявшаяся в кадре, приходит им на помощь и убивает Зверя, обезглавив его. Эта фигура оказывается Седьмой.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-17": "Девятый замечает Талисман и вставляет его в разъём, идеально ему подходящий. Второй пытается остановить его, но слишком поздно — Машина для Изготовления пробуждается и высасывает душу Второго, убивая его.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-18": "Девятый, Пятый и Седьмая сбегают с Фабрики и от Машины. Пятый и Седьмая строго спрашивают Девятого, о чём он думал, и он извиняется. Все они направляются в библиотеку, где встречаются с Третьим и Четвёртым. Девятый спрашивает, знают ли они что-нибудь о Машине или Талисмане. В ответ те показывают старый фильм, в котором изображены Война Машин и МОЗГ.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-19": "Девятый и Пятый решают вернуться в Собор и пригласить Седьмую присоединиться, но она отказывается. Вскоре их ловит Восьмой, а Первый кричит на них за то, что они покинули Собор. Появляется Шестой и пытается рассказать Девятому об «Источнике», но не может сформулировать мысль.",

    "history-of-the-ninth-1": "Девятый — последний и наиболее молодой из Стичпанков, созданных Учёным как фрагменты его души. Он пробуждается уже после окончания разрушительной Войны Машин, в полном одиночестве, среди руин опустевшего мира. Не зная ничего о своём предназначении и окружении, он начинает исследовать разрушенный пейзаж и вскоре встречает Второго — мудрого и доброжелательного Стичпанка, который дарует ему голосовой аппарат и становится его первым проводником в новом мире.",

    "history-of-the-ninth-2": "С самых первых шагов Девятый проявляет глубокое любопытство, инициативу и сочувствие. Он не просто следует за другими — он стремится к истине, задаёт вопросы и не боится нарушать запреты, если чувствует, что это важно. Именно Девятый становится катализатором ключевых событий сюжета: он случайно активирует Талисман, что приводит к пробуждению Машины Изготовления, однако позднее он же помогает объединить оставшихся Стичпанков для борьбы против неё.",

    "history-of-the-ninth-3": "Его путь наполнен утратами, трудными решениями и личностным ростом. Он учится на ошибках, переживает вину за смерть Второго и других, но не сдаётся. Постепенно Девятый осознаёт, что судьба мира и будущее Стичпанков зависит от его выбора. Его стремление восстановить справедливость, разобраться в наследии Учёного и защитить тех, кто ему дорог, делает Девятого центральной фигурой истории и символом надежды.",


    "ninth-title-appearance-1": "Внешность и личность",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-1": "Девятый — один из самых искренних членов группы, ставящий других выше себя. Поначалу он довольно наивен, но быстро учится преодолевать этот недостаток, развивая свою интуицию.",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-2": "Между ним из короткометражки и полнометражного фильма нет явных различий. Он немой, а его мешковина, кажется, более тёмного цвета, но в остальном существенных отличий нет. Он сохраняет большую часть своей личности, особенно любопытство. В короткометражке он выступает в роли ученика (намного старшего) Пятого.",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-3": "Он, по-видимому, — единственный выживший из Стичпанков (из-за террора, устроенного Кошачьим Зверем), и полагается на своё окружение и смекалку, чтобы победить Зверя и отомстить за своих павших товарищей.",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-4": "В фильме 2009 года Девятый представлен в образе коричневого мешковинного Стичпанка. У него спереди золотисто-жёлтая молния, застёгивающая живот, а на спине вытатуирована цифра «9». Изначально у него не было голосового аппарата, из-за чего он был немым, однако благодаря Второму это было исправлено.",


    "ninth-title-features-1": "Особенности",

    "ninth-features-1": "Девятый выделяется среди других Стичпанков своей любознательностью, смелостью и сильным стремлением к пониманию окружающего мира. Он пробуждается позже остальных, в полном одиночестве, что формирует в нём чувство ответственности за происходящее. В отличие от других, он не боится задавать неудобные вопросы и сомневаться в авторитетах, включая Первого, что делает его своеобразным революционером среди Стичпанков.",

    "ninth-features-2": "Его проницательность и быстрая реакция позволяют принимать решения в критические моменты, даже если он не всегда предугадывает последствия. Девятый действует интуитивно, нередко полагаясь на внутренний моральный компас, что, с одной стороны, делает его уязвимым к ошибкам, но с другой — подчёркивает его человечность.",

    "ninth-features-3": "Несмотря на начальную наивность, он быстро взрослеет, сталкиваясь с утратой и опасностью. Он обладает даром вдохновлять других своим примером, побуждая их действовать, когда кажется, что всё потеряно. Его отношения с другими персонажами, особенно с Пятым, Вторым и Седьмой, подчеркивают его способность к сочувствию, заботе и лидерству.",

    "ninth-features-4": "Внешне Девятый отличается светло-коричневой мешковиной, застёгнутой молнией спереди, и яркой цифрой «9» на спине. Его движения лёгкие, но решительные. Благодаря голосовому аппарату, подаренному Вторым, он может выражать свои мысли и чувства, что сближает его с остальными и даёт возможность направлять группу в трудные времена.",

    "ninth-features-5": "Именно сочетание храбрости, эмпатии, интеллекта и готовности идти до конца делает Девятого не просто участником событий, а сердцем и душой сопротивления против Машины.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-3": "Неизвестно, почему у Девятого изначально не было голосового аппарата. Предполагается, что у Учёного не было другого голосового аппарата для Девятого, хотя в теоретических исследованиях отсек для вставки, который мог быть прикреплённым голосовым аппаратом, использовался в качестве слота для талисмана — что, скорее всего, является отсылкой к оригинальному короткометражному фильму 2005 года.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-4": "Когда Девятый вырвался из банки, в которой прятался, он потерял часть ткани и шва, что ослабило текстильную защиту левого плеча. Когда Пятый зашивает его новой красной нитью, его рука не только не будет немного ограничена, но и сможет свободно двигать ею.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-5": "Вполне возможно, что и Девятый, и Седьмая испытывают друг к другу романтические привязанности/чувства.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-6": "В удалённой сцене, после того как все погибшие стичпанки освободились, душа Шестого переносится в музыкальную шкатулку (позже она была заменена на послание для Девятого) с зеркалом и металлической табличкой со словом «НАДЕЖДА». Девятый вытаскивает небольшой обрывок бумаги с надписью «Последний», завершая тем самым свою мысль. Это могло бы быть частью ранней концепции фильма.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-7": "В комментарии упоминается, что Девятый является катализатором группы.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-8": "9 и остальные стикпанки очень похожи на Сэкбоя из серии Little Big Planet для PlayStation. Однако, поскольку они были созданы в разные годы: 9 — в 2005-м, а Сэкбой — в 2008-м, это, скорее всего, простое совпадение. Хотя, возможно, дизайн Сэкбоя был вдохновлён оригинальным короткометражным фильмом.",

    "eighth-description-paragraph-2": "Несмотря на грозный вид, Восьмой не злой по своей природе — он просто слепо подчиняется приказам и не привык действовать самостоятельно. Ему сложно выражать мысли, поэтому он чаще действует силой.",

    "eighth-description-paragraph-3": "Он вооружён зажигалкой с трутом, которую использует как огнемёт. Его сила делает его опасным, но в нём чувствуется внутренняя борьба — возможно, он способен на большее, если освободится от влияния Первого.",

    "eighth-description-paragraph-biography-2": "Восьмой проснулся в четверг, 3 сентября, в 16:30 и был воспринят как «гигант», «густой сгусток силы», «сплошные мускулы, но не слишком умные». Его извлекли из Учёного на следующий день в 15:26. Несмотря на меньший рост, он сумел запугать Учёного.",

    "eighth-description-paragraph-biography-3": "Во время Войны Машин Восьмой помог нынешней группе стичпанков укрыться под шлемом бывшего солдата в целях защиты. Когда Седьмая вернулась к остальным с Близнецами, Восьмой приподнял шлем, чтобы они могли войти, а затем помог нести его — на этот раз очень низко, чтобы все могли двигаться. Однако взрыв попал в стену рядом с их укрытием, оставив Пятого позади. Восьмому удалось помочь Первому собрать остальных, среди которых был потерявший сознание и теперь одноглазый Пятый, находившийся под шлемом. Группе удалось добраться до Святилища, где они укрылись в ожидании окончания войны.",

Он с самого начала представлен как телохранитель Первого — грубый, но верный. Его история — это путь существа, которое редко принимает решения самостоятельно, подчиняясь приказам без осмысления. Будучи символом силы без воли, он служит скорее инструментом, чем личностью.",

    "eighth-history-paragraph-description-2": "Несмотря на устрашающий облик, Восьмой не зол по своей природе. Он часто действует из страха или растерянности, а не по злобе. Во время Войны Машин он помогал остальным выжившим, пряча их под шлемом солдата и неся его, чтобы укрыться от разрушений. В его действиях иногда проскальзывает забота, особенно в моменты, когда он теряет контроль.",

    "eighth-history-paragraph-description-3": "Его трагедия в том, что он стал жертвой слепого послушания. Он не понимал, что некоторые его поступки приносят вред тем, кого он должен был защищать.

    "eighth-appearance-and-personality-paragraph-3": "Восьмой, по-видимому, сделан из старого носка. Он гораздо крупнее и массивнее других Стичпанков. У него широкий, обезьяний рот, маленькие глаза по сравнению с размером тела и большие руки. Поскольку у всех Стичпанков под кожей есть защитный слой, у Восьмого, похоже, имеются дополнительные прослойки, выполняющие функцию мышц. Он носит металлический ошейник-жилет, собранный из обрезков пильного полотна. Его номер нарисован на руке, а не на спине.",

    "eighth-appearance-and-personality-paragraph-4": "Вооружение Восьмого включает солонку, используемую как шлем или маску, огромный кухонный нож в качестве основного оружия и ножницы-лезвия, применяемые как метательные ножи. У него также есть магнит, с помощью которого он крепит свои лезвия.

Когда Девятый возвращается и сообщает, что каждый из них — часть души Учёного, Семёрка поражена и на мгновение теряет дар речи. Их неутомимая борьба продолжается, пока Машина преследует их по туннелю. Девятый объясняет, как использовать Талисман после того, как он будет захвачен, намекая на собственное самопожертвование. Семёрка настаивает, чтобы он не делал этого, но Девятому удаётся убедить её. Она присутствует в момент, когда Первый отталкивает Девятого, жертвуя собой.",

Ещё с момента своего пробуждения она отличалась волевым характером, независимостью и внутренней решимостью не подчиняться слепо приказам. В отличие от других, она не приняла авторитет Первого, который стремился установить контроль над остальными. Семёрка покинула убежище, чтобы самостоятельно бороться с Машинами, считая, что действия и смелость — единственный путь к спасению.",

Её возвращение совпадает с нападением Кошачьего Зверя: она вмешивается в самый критический момент и спасает Второго и Пятого, обезглавив противника.

Она сражается до конца — с оружием в руках, в эпицентре опасностей, и остаётся рядом, когда решается судьба всей группы. В последние минуты она, вместе с Третьим, Четвёртым и Девятым, становится свидетелем жертвы Первого и окончательного поражения Машины.",

В то же время она заботится о Тройке и Четвёрке, играя для них роль матери. В начале фильма она была более закалённой, но с появлением Девятого начала проявлять более чувствительную и эмоциональную сторону.",

    "seventh-appearance-view-2": "После первой встречи с Девятым Семёрка становится более мягкой. Её часто раздражает его беспечность и те проблемы, в которые он втягивает стичпанков, особенно в момент, когда она отчитывает его после гибели Второго и Пятого. В конце концов она начинает заботиться о нём и даже пытается убедить его не жертвовать собой.",

Она особенно трепетно относится к Тройке и Четвёрке, оберегая их как старшая сестра или даже мать. Именно в этой заботе проявляется её человечность — в мире, где выживание требует жестокости, она сохраняет способность любить и защищать.",

Семёрка не стремится к власти и не навязывает свои решения, но её уверенность, лидерские качества и готовность брать ответственность часто делают её естественным лидером, особенно в критические моменты.",

    "sixth-history-1": "В мультфильме «Девять» Шестой представлен как один из самых загадочных и неоднозначных стичпанков. Он живёт в изоляции от остальных, погружённый в собственный мир, где главную роль играют пророческие видения и навязчивые символы. Его тело покрыто метками и чернилами, а стены укрытия исписаны странными рисунками — повторяющимися знаками и схемами, которые никто не может расшифровать. Для окружающих он кажется странным, даже пугающим, но за этой внешней отчуждённостью скрывается глубокий внутренний мир, наполненный знанием, интуицией и трагическим пониманием происходящего.",

    "sixth-history-2": "Шестой обладает особым восприятием реальности: он предчувствует угрозу со стороны Машины и знает о значении Талисмана задолго до того, как остальные начинают это осознавать. Его первая встреча с Девятым становится поворотным моментом — именно Девятый впервые воспринимает его всерьёз и начинает искать смысл в загадочных посланиях. Шестой охотно делится своими знаниями, хотя и не может объяснить их напрямую: он словно ведом силой, которую сам до конца не понимает, но чувствует всем своим существом.",

    "sixth-history-3": "Трагедия Шестого заключается в том, что, несмотря на свою осведомлённость и искреннее желание помочь, он остаётся непонятым и отвергнутым большинством. Он предупреждает о грядущей беде, но его слова игнорируют, а страх перед его «инаковостью» оказывается сильнее. В конце концов, его судьба становится символом жертвенности и пророческой истины, которую не удалось предотвратить. Его смерть от рук Машины — одна из самых драматичных сцен, в которой он молча отдаёт себя, зная, что несёт важнейший ключ к спасению других.",

    "sixth-history-4": "Шестой — не просто носитель информации, он — воплощение предчувствия, интуиции и глубинного знания. Его путь — это путь одиночества, боли и непонятости, но в то же время — путь истины. Его чертежи становятся частью карты, по которой Девятый и остальные находят своё предназначение и способ противостоять Машине. Даже после своей гибели Шестой остаётся с ними — в памяти, в рисунках, в пробуждённой вере в то, что каждая душа, даже самая одинокая, имеет своё значение.",

Это самый проницательный стежпанк в группе, который редко говорит и предпочитает выражать свои мысли через креативные узоры и рисунки. Он способен создавать их с помощью пера, которое служит ему вместо пальцев. Судя по его эксцентричным работам и общей отстранённости, очевидно, что он видит мир иначе, чем другие стежпанки. У него есть особые видения прошлого и будущего, которые непосредственно касаются каждого из персонажей и/или Машины. Вероятно, он рисует то, что видит во снах — большинство из этих образов посвящены Талисману и трём основным алхимическим символам на нём. Его рисунки, по сути, раскрыли большинство ответов на вопросы Девятого о происходящем. К сожалению, остальные персонажи с трудом понимали их значение или просто отвергали как бред безумного разума.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-2": "В фильме Шестой, безусловно, живёт в своём собственном мире — или, по крайней мере, в своём восприятии этого мира. Он качает головой, словно пытается прояснить сознание или пробудиться от сна. Это особенно заметно в сцене, когда Пятый возвращает его к реальности во время битвы с Крылатым Зверем. Шестой способен полностью погружаться в свои мысли — даже в ситуациях, угрожающих жизни. Когда же он не погружён в себя, он выглядит более напуганным, чем любой другой стежкопанк, вероятно, потому что лучше других осознаёт, от чего им всем приходится скрываться.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-3": "Шестой выглядит как серо-белый полосатый стежкопанк. Застёжки на его шее, запястьях и лодыжках, по-видимому, сделаны из медной проволоки, трижды обмотанной вокруг каждой из этих частей тела. На голове у него — клок серо-белой пряжи, но со временем и в процессе рисования он сильно испачкался чёрными чернилами. Фанаты с интересом наблюдают, как он проводит пальцами, всё ещё покрытыми чернилами, по своей голове, когда расстроен или испытывает видение. Один его глаз заметно больше другого, что может подчёркивать его нестабильное психическое состояние.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-4": "На шее Шестой носит большой старомодный ключ на связке, который он часто сжимает в моменты страха или тревоги. В вырезанной сцене «Наследие Учёного» подтверждается, что этот ключ открывает музыкальную или ювелирную шкатулку Учёного, предназначенную для Девятого. На теле Шестого, а также на кончиках его перьевых пальцев заметны кляксы и пятна чернил.",

Он видит то, чего не видят другие, ощущает надвигающуюся угрозу задолго до её появления. Его разум как будто напрямую связан с энергией Талисмана, и именно через него проявляется знание, оставленное Учёным.",

    "sixth-features-2": "Его особенность — это постоянное внутреннее напряжение между стремлением понять истину и невозможностью донести её до других. Он почти не говорит — не потому, что не может, а потому что слова кажутся ему слишком грубым инструментом для передачи того, что он ощущает. Вместо этого он рисует: чернила становятся его голосом, а линии — шепотом будущего. Его рисунки полны аллюзий на алхимию, циклы жизни и смерти, механизмы Машины и силу талисмана. Многие из них поначалу непонятны, но позже становятся ключом к спасению.",

    "sixth-features-3": "Внешне Шестой кажется отрешённым, слабым и даже испуганным — особенно в моменты, когда интуитивно чувствует надвигающуюся катастрофу. Он может впадать в трансы, раскачиваться, будто пытается «встряхнуть» видение или прийти в себя из глубокого внутреннего диалога. Однако в этой хрупкости скрыта мощная глубина. Его жертва становится поворотной точкой в истории: именно благодаря его пророчествам и подсказкам Девятый начинает понимать, как победить Машину и раскрыть истинный смысл талисмана.",

    "sixth-features-4": "Шестой — это живой мост между логикой и интуицией, наукой и мистикой, страхом и озарением. В нём заключена память о прошлом и знание о будущем. Он — не воин, не лидер, но его молчаливая мудрость оставляет след гораздо глубже, чем любые действия.",

Пятый тут же передаёт Талисман Девятому и отталкивает его, побуждая бежать и прятаться. Достав самодельное складное копьё из своего живота и разложив его, Пятый готовится к бою. Кот-Зверь подкрадывается сзади и хватает его одной из своих острых металлических лап, сбивая с ног. Вскоре Пятый приходит в себя, но в самый неподходящий момент — Кот-Зверь активирует талисман и смотрит ему прямо в лицо. Несмотря на попытки сопротивления, Пятый не может вырваться, и его душа засасывается в талисман через пасть, оставляя перед глазами Девятого безжизненную тряпичную оболочку.",

Его фигура — скромная, сшитая из мешковины, с одним единственным глазом — излучает тепло, которое особенно выделяется на фоне разрушенного и безжизненного мира. Его первое появление происходит в момент, когда Девятый только начинает осознавать, где он очутился. Пятый не задаёт лишних вопросов, не проявляет страха или агрессии — вместо этого он помогает: чинит, делится инструментами, обучает. Его забота искренняя, почти отцовская, и она сразу формирует прочную эмоциональную связь между ним и Девятым.",

Но настоящая глубина его характера раскрывается в сцене жертвы: когда Кот-Зверь приближается, Пятый инстинктивно защищает Девятого, передаёт ему Талисман и отталкивает от опасности. Без колебаний он идёт навстречу угрозе, вооружившись лишь своим складным копьём, хотя прекрасно понимает, что, возможно, не переживёт эту схватку.",

    "fifth-history-4": "Его смерть — трагична, но героична. Пятый погибает, но не напрасно: именно его действия позволяют Девятому спастись и продолжить борьбу. Позже, в финальной сцене, его душа поднимается в небо вместе с другими павшими героями, навсегда оставив след в памяти Девятого — и в сердцах зрителей. Это прощание, наполненное светом, завершает его путь с достоинством и теплотой. Пятый — символ сострадания, самоотдачи и доброты в мире, где всё это кажется утраченным.",

Его тело сшито из той же мешковины, что и у Девятого, и украшено двумя пуговицами спереди. Известно, что он хранит различные мелочи и полезные предметы внутри своей тканевой оболочки для удобства, включая Талисман в короткометражке 2005 года. Как именно он нашёл Зеркальный Талисман — остаётся неизвестным. В той же короткометражке его единственным оружием является самодельное складное копьё, которое можно складывать и раскладывать.",

    "fifth-appearance-2": "Пятый предстаёт в образе одноглазого, заботливого и добросердечного инженера. Он верен своим друзьям, великодушен — настоящий «обычный человек», играющий роль миротворца и целителя. Он очень добрый, наивный и доверчивый, хотя временами проявляет и робость. По мнению некоторых критиков, он словно помощник Девятого. Он невероятно близок со Вторым, который был его наставником во многих ремеслах. Их первым совместным изобретением стал телескоп, который можно увидеть на вершине Сторожевой башни.",

    "fifth-appearance-3": "В короткометражном фильме 2005 года у Пятого есть повязка из формованного гребня, которая закрывает часть его лица, где когда-то был глаз. Его оболочка выполнена из более лёгкой мешковины, чем у Девятого, но левая ступня сделана из материала Первого. В фильме, помимо металлической лески, прикреплённой к левой ступне проволокой, и ржавого крюка возле правой ноги, Пятый, как и Девятый, не произносит ни слова.",

    "fifth-appearance-4": "Подобно своему образу в короткометражке 2005 года, Пятый имеет один глаз и две пуговицы на груди, создающие впечатление застёгнутой рубашки, напоминающей рабочую униформу. Он носит «рюкзак», сделанный из карты Таро и напёрстка, в котором хранит свою карту, а также различные мелочи и полезные предметы для путешествий. Его оружие — миниатюрный арбалет, собранный из пружин и металлолома, стреляющий иглами, а также нечто вроде абордажного устройства с рыболовными крючками и верёвкой, предположительно сделанного им самим. Кроме того, он использует карту окрестностей Святилища.",

    "fifth-appearance-5": "У Пятого раньше было два глаза, но один он потерял во время войны, когда за его спиной упала газовая бомба. От взрыва он потерял равновесие, упал и ударился левым глазом об землю.",

    "fifth-appearance-6": "Сначала Пятый боится Первого, но при этом проявляет уважение и подчиняется его приказам. Однако с появлением Девятого он наконец проявляет смелость и даже вмешивается, не позволяя Первому поджечь Фабрику, пока Девятый и Седьмая всё ещё были внутри.",

С первых минут становится понятно, что Близнецы обладают особыми чертами: они движутся синхронно, словно тени друг друга, и обладают почти телепатическим взаимопониманием. Их молчаливое присутствие создаёт атмосферу загадочности, а постоянная слаженность делает их похожими на единый организм, разделённый между двумя телами.",

Именно Третий и Четвёртый берут на себя роль архивариусов: они молниеносно находят нужные материалы, включая старые вырезки из газет, научные документы и видеозаписи, проливающие свет на происхождение Машины Изготовления и её связь с Талисманом. В этот момент зритель понимает, что Близнецы — не просто помощники: они — хранители коллективной памяти и знаний, уцелевших в мире, охваченном хаосом.",

Они не вступают в конфликты, не принимают решений, но их молчаливая поддержка ощущается повсюду. Будь то момент поиска информации, взаимодействие с Шестым при изучении Талисмана или сцена на фоне разрушенной фабрики — Близнецы всегда рядом, наблюдают, анализируют, понимают. Их интеллект выражается не словами, а поступками, и именно это делает их особенными.",

    "third-and-fourth-history-4": "Особенно трогательной становится сцена с фонографом, когда Близнецы запускают запись «Somewhere Over the Rainbow». Этот момент не только несёт в себе глубокую символику надежды, но и раскрывает чувствительную, человечную сторону Третьего и Четвёртого. В разрушенном мире они нашли минуту для красоты, музыки и покоя, предложив её другим. Это тихое действие говорит громче любого слова, словно подчёркивая: даже в тишине можно передать тепло, сострадание и веру в лучшее.",

Никогда ранее не видевшие дождя, они удивлены и тронуты этим моментом. В их жесте — не только интерес, но и надежда.

В них нет суеты, агрессии или страха — они спокойны, сосредоточены и по-своему мудры.

Однако когда Девятый помещает Талисман в Машину и активирует её, Второй уже слишком поздно, чтобы попытаться остановить его. Он совершает серьёзную ошибку — просто смотрит на Машину, прежде чем издать приглушённый крик, когда его душа поглощается устройством, и он падает замертво.

    "char-1-biography-2": "Впервые Первый появляется, когда Пятый разговаривает с недавно исцелившимся Девятым. Он приказывает Восьмому отвести их в укрытие, где рассказывает Девятому о войне. Однако он запрещает Пятому и Девятому покидать укрытие и пытаться спасти Второго. Когда они возвращаются, Первый приходит в ярость и читает Девятому лекцию о том, как тот нарушил приказы и подверг всех опасности.",

В кульминационный момент битвы существо оказывается прикреплённым к пропеллеру обломков самолёта, но удерживается, вцепившись в плащ Первого. Шестой помогает Пятому активировать механизм, однако пропеллер не запускается — Крылатый Зверь продолжает цепляться. Девятый призывает Первого отпустить плащ. Тот, хоть и с трудом, подчиняется. Зверь падает на пропеллер и разлетается на куски. Вместо благодарности за сообразительность, Первый сухо говорит Девятому, что теперь он ему обязан.",

    "char-1-biography-4": "Первый неохотно соглашается последовать за остальными в библиотеку, чтобы отдохнуть и восстановиться после битвы. Там он читает группе лекцию о том, что не стоит постоянно задавать вопросы, как это делал Второй. Эти слова наводят Девятого на мысль, что Первый мог намеренно послать Второго на смерть. Седьмая, услышав это, едва не нападает на него.",

    "char-1-biography-5": "Позже его показывают в одиночестве, идущим между стеллажей, задумчиво размышляющим о своих мотивах. Он не замечает, как к нему подкрадывается Швея. Он видит лишь, как безжизненный Второй подходит к нему и гипнотизирует его. Швея начинает зашивать Первого. После битвы он предлагает покинуть это место и найти новое укрытие, но Девятый убеждает его, что пора перестать прятаться. Именно тогда Первый отказывается от роли лидера стежкопанков — и передаёт её Девятому.",

    "char-1-biography-6": "После того как Машина, казалось бы, уничтожена, Первый садится один и смотрит в небо, сняв шляпу, пока остальные развлекаются, играя на фонографе.

    "char-1-appearance-history-1": "Во вселенной мультфильма «Девять» Первый предстает как строгий, решительный и противоречивый лидер сшитых. Он был первым, кого создал Учёный, и с самого начала взял на себя бремя ответственности за выживание остальных. Первый верит в порядок, дисциплину и контроль как единственные инструменты выживания в мире, разрушенном войной. Его характер сформирован страхом перед хаосом и болью утрат, которые он больше не может себе позволить. Он не принимает импульсивных решений и не склонен к сочувствию, предпочитая сдержанность и расчёт.",

    "char-1-appearance-history-2": "Его поведение нередко воспринимается как жестокое или равнодушное, но за этим скрывается глубокое желание сохранить то немногое, что осталось. Он видит в себе щит для остальных — пусть даже этот щит трескается под давлением. Его отношения с другими сшитыми сложны: кто-то его уважает, кто-то — боится, а кто-то — бросает вызов. Особенно напряжённы его взаимодействия с Девятым, который символизирует перемены, спонтанность и веру в другой путь. Первый с трудом принимает новые идеи, потому что боится, что они снова приведут к катастрофе.",

    "char-1-appearance-history-3": "Внутри Первого идёт постоянная борьба между долгом и сомнением. Он тяжело переживает каждую потерю и носит в себе вину за принятые решения, даже если не показывает этого. Под маской лидера скрывается уставший и израненный воин, который слишком долго нёс всё на своих плечах. В финале истории он совершает акт настоящего самоотречения: уступает лидерство Девятому и осознаёт, что доверие — это тоже сила. Его жертва становится не только символом отваги, но и актом искупления за все ошибки прошлого. Таким образом, Первый остаётся важнейшей фигурой — неидеальной, но необходимой.",


    "char-1-appearance-title-1": "Внешность и личность",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-1": "Первый, похоже, сделан из бледной ткани. Его руки и ноги металлические: кисти имеют корявую, когтистую форму, а ноги разделены на три металлические пластины, напоминающие лапы с когтями. Его голова вытянутая, с высокими «скулами», а под тканевой поверхностью, судя по всему, скрывается череп. Он застёгивается на металлические пряжки и, по-видимому, залатан вручную.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-2": "После войны, добравшись до Святилища, Первый получает плащ, сделанный из лоскута красного шёлка, скреплённого рубиновой брошью, а также металлический посох с прикреплённой ржавой шестерёнкой и колокольчиком на конце. Он носит импровизированную «папскую шляпу», сделанную из пулевой гильзы, к которой прикреплена латунная одноцентовая монета на проволоке. Этот наряд придаёт Первому сходство с религиозной фигурой высокого ранга — прежде всего с епископом.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-3": "Примечательно, что такой образ выбран как аллюзия: в прошлом религиозные лидеры, подобно Первому, отвергали критику, избегали вопросов о Церкви (Первый уклоняется от обсуждения происхождения сшитых), были догматичны и враждебны к науке (в его случае — к алхимии). Его зрачки отличаются от оптики других сшитых: они треугольные, а не круглые, и могут расширяться при страхе. В отличие от большинства, у Первого нет пришитых бровей, но на ткани над глазами есть углубления, имитирующие их.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-4": "На протяжении фильма Первый постепенно теряет лидерский статус, а вместе с ним — посох, плащ и головной убор. После уничтожения фабрики Машины Изготовления он отказывается от своего титула. Однако позже вновь принимает на себя роль лидера, когда Девятый отправляется на поиски мастерской Учёного, хотя теперь это лидерство становится более формальным и терпимым.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-5": "Посох Первого служит не только символом власти, но и практическим инструментом. Поскольку Первый, как и Второй, может быть довольно старым, он использует его для опоры при ходьбе. В то же время посох может использоваться как оружие: Первый хватает им Пятого за шею, чтобы притянуть ближе, и делает то же самое с Девятым при первой встрече, чтобы рассмотреть его номер.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-6": "Посох сделан из затупившейся швейной иглы, половины шестерёнки и маленького колокольчика, что придаёт ему уникальный и угрожающий вид. Этот предмет теряется в момент атаки Крылатого Зверя, когда Девятый роняет его, спасаясь от нападения.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-7": "Шляпа Первого, напоминающая папский головной убор, используется им для того, чтобы скрыть свою довольно своеобразную «причёску» и подчеркнуть образ правителя. Она сделана из сломанного колпачка свечи, к которому прикреплена люксембургская одноцентовая монета. Эта монета падает, когда Первого ловит Швея (но его спасает Девятый).",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-8": "Ближе к финалу истории Первый снимает шляпу, и, возможно, она раздавливается Машиной для Изготовления. В сцене воспоминаний о Войне его головной убор выглядит иначе — он сделан из использованной гильзы, что подчёркивает его военное прошлое.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-9": "Плащ: красный шёлковый плащ, возможно, оторванный от старой занавески и застёгнутый на шее рубиновой брошью, делает Первого ещё более похожим на короля и подчёркивает его стремление к авторитету и величию.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-10": "Первый представляет собой тревожную и авторитарную часть личности Учёного. Он был первым гомункулом, созданным в группе, и сам назначил себя лидером. Обладает самоуверенным и диктаторским характером, отказывается идти на компромиссы и твёрдо придерживается собственных взглядов, даже если это угрожает другим. Он готов пожертвовать другими ради собственной безопасности — как это показано, когда он отправляет Второго в Пустошь, зная об опасности.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-11": "Однако со временем его поведение меняется. Противостояние с Девятым, укоры за отказ искать ответы о происхождении сшитых, стыд за судьбу Второго — всё это заставляет Первого задуматься. Когда Девятый предлагает пожертвовать собой ради спасения Седьмой и извлечения Талисмана из Машины Изготовления, Первый делает выбор — сам приносит себя в жертву, чтобы дать Девятому шанс. Он становится пятым и последним из сшитых, кто погибает в фильме.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-12": "Первый не разделяет идеализм Девятого и предпочитает скрываться в своём убежище, вместо того чтобы действовать.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-13": "Восьмой — самый преданный спутник Первого и его послушный телохранитель.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-14": "Первый считает Седьмую предательницей — скорее всего потому, что она покинула Святилище, чтобы сражаться с машинами.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-15": "Первый избегает Шестого, считая его поведение слишком странным и непредсказуемым для доверия.",

    "char-1-appearance-brief-16": "Первый относится к Пятому нейтрально, хотя и с лёгкой снисходительностью — до тех пор, пока тот не соглашается пойти с Девятым, чтобы спасти Второго.",

    "char-1-features-1": "Первый — это стойкий и авторитарный лидер, символизирующий порядок, контроль и ответственность. Он был создан первым из всех сшитых, и с самого начала принял на себя роль главы, считая это своим долгом. Его внешний вид — массивный корпус, металлические конечности, красная повязка и посох — подчёркивает не только его власть, но и его стремление быть опорой для других. Его поза всегда прямая, движения точные и экономные, словно он бережёт энергию, чтобы держать всё под контролем.",

    "char-1-features-2": "Каждый элемент его образа продуман: посох не только символ лидерства, но и инструмент защиты; повязка — знак статуса, почти ритуальный; его головной убор напоминает церковный, что отсылает к авторитету и догме. Его взгляд — напряжённый, пристальный, порой тяжёлый, как у того, кто постоянно оценивает ситуацию, взвешивает риски и принимает решения за всех. Он говорит редко, но твёрдо, не допуская возражений.",

    "char-1-features-3": "Несмотря на внешнюю суровость, за его поступками скрываются боль утрат и тяжесть личной ответственности. Он не жесток по природе — он просто не верит, что мягкость может спасти. Его страх перед хаосом, перед повторением прошлых катастроф заставляет его держаться за контроль, даже если это отталкивает других. Но внутри него идёт борьба: между тем, кем он должен быть, и тем, кем он мог бы быть. И именно в момент, когда он уступает Девятому роль лидера, становится ясно — Первый способен на рост, на жертву и на то, чтобы отпустить.",

Ее правительство представляло собой тоталитарную диктатуру, которой управлял канцлер, обладавший абсолютной властью над своей страной. Граждане не только поддерживали его действия, но и считали его выдающимся и харизматичным лидером. Будучи экономически развитой державой, Нация под руководством канцлера стремилась к расширению и мировому господству. Однако его амбиции приняли мрачный оборот, как только началась война. Основная философия Нации заключалась в идеях «силы и прогресса».",

Страна является тоталитарной диктатурой, значительно превосходит своих европейских соседей в технологическом плане (вплоть до создания искусственного интеллекта). Её официальный флаг метафорически напоминает нацистскую свастику, а канцлер похож на Адольфа Гитлера военной формой и манерами. Однако он лишён фирменных усов и причёски.

Латынь имела статус официального языка Западной Римской империи (из которой Германия и многие другие европейские страны — Франция, Испания и др. — возникли в течение столетий после её распада в 476 году н. э.). Поскольку население было англоязычным, некоторые фанаты полагали, что страна может быть альтернативной Британией или Ирландией. Другие считали, что она могла находиться в России из-за её схожих советских черт. Лишь немногие предполагали, что это могла быть альтернативная Франция, Италия или Испания из-за знакомого архитектурного стиля квартиры Учёного в начале.

С этого момента механизмы стали представлять смертельную угрозу: они истребляли всех людей без различия национальности, пока не положили конец человечеству и почти всей жизни на Земле.",

    "chancellor-party-history-4": "После смерти канцлера Фердинанда, уничтожения его армии машинами и гибели граждан страны (большинство из которых поддерживало его режим) в Войне машин партия фактически прекратила своё существование. К моменту событий фильма «9» от неё остались лишь пропагандистские плакаты и лозунги, доживавшие своё среди руин Нации.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-title-1": "Характеристики логотипа",

    "chancellor-party-logo-1": "Эмблема символизировала Нацию Канцлера и была одним из главных атрибутов его режима. Она имела форму с тремя острыми углами, из которых центральный был больше двух других, что подчёркивало идею превосходства и силы. В основании находился круг, а центральный элемент был выделен красным цветом, усиливая ассоциации с агрессией и властью.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-2": "Основная часть знака была выполнена в чёрном цвете и заключена в красный треугольник. Такое сочетание оттенков делало эмблему мрачной и угрожающей, вызывая ощущение силы и подавления. Дизайн явно отсылал к символике реальных тоталитарных партий XX века, особенно к свастике, используемой нацистской партией, с которой партия Канцлера имела много общего по идеологии и методам.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-3": "Эмблема активно использовалась в пропаганде и присутствовала повсюду. Её можно было увидеть на баннерах, украшавших стены зданий, на плакатах с изображением Канцлера, а также в лаборатории Учёного Нации, когда он работал над созданием МОЗГа. Таким образом, символ сопровождал не только военную, но и научную сферу государства, подчёркивая полный контроль партии над обществом.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-4": "Даже боевые машины несли на себе этот знак. Стальные Бегемоты, созданные Производственной Машиной, имели эмблему на боках своих головных частей. Более того, брезент, из которого были сделаны крылья Крылатого Зверя, также содержал изображение символа. Всё это превращало эмблему в олицетворение режима Канцлера и его стремления распространить своё влияние на все сферы жизни — от архитектуры и науки до армии и созданных машин.",

    "chancellor-party-gallery-title-1": "Галерея",

    "chancellor-party-gallery-1": "В галерее собраны агитационные постеры и изображения, отражающие идеологию партии канцлера. Эти материалы использовались для пропаганды среди населения и подчёркивают влияние символики на общество. Постеры демонстрируют культ силы, военной дисциплины и подчинения, а также раскрывают параллели с тоталитарными режимами XX века.",

    "chancellor-party-gallery-2": "Каждый плакат несёт в себе особое настроение: от пафосных лозунгов о «светлом будущем» до изображений, которые в дальнейшем стали символами сопротивления. Галерея позволяет проследить, как визуальная культура партии канцлера превратилась в орудие психологического давления на людей и важный элемент атмосферы мира «9».",

    "chancellor-party-gallery-quote-1": "«Плакаты партии олицетворяли власть, силу и идеологию режима.»",

    "chancellor-party-facts-title-1": "Интересные факты",

    "chancellor-party-fact-1": "Широкое распространение символа рейхсканцлера Фердинанда в СМИ напоминает о нацистской Германии, где свастика также стала важным элементом массовой пропаганды в конце 1930-х годов. Цвета символа рейхсканцлера во многом схожи с цветами нацистской свастики.",

    "chancellor-party-fact-2": "Издалека Фабрика странным образом олицетворяет символ нации, что подчёркивает её связь с идеологией и милитаризмом партии.",

    "chancellor-party-fact-3": "Символ партии канцлера можно заметить не только на плакатах, но и на военной технике: он изображён на корпусах Стальных Бегемотов и даже на крыльях Крылатого Зверя.",

    "chancellor-party-fact-4": "В лаборатории Учёного, где создавался МОЗГ, эмблема партии также присутствует, что подчёркивает тотальный контроль идеологии даже над наукой.",

    "chancellor-party-fact-5": "Массовое использование эмблемы должно было вызывать у граждан ассоциацию с силой, порядком и «светлым будущим», что является типичным элементом тоталитарной пропаганды XX века.",

    "bookmark-machine-war-1": "Война машин",

    "machine-war-p1": "Война машин стала необоснованным решением канцлера: военные машины были введены в эксплуатацию в то время, как другие страны, всё ещё находившиеся в кризисе, стремились осуществить свои планы мирового господства.",

    "machine-war-p2": "Вместо укрепления мира и восстановления после тяжёлых испытаний, это решение лишь ускорило глобальный конфликт. К сожалению, война быстро обернулась против человечества, погрузив мир в хаос и в конечном итоге приведя его к вымиранию.",

    "machine-war-box-1": "Война машин — трагедия,<br>ставшая концом человеческой цивилизации",

    "machine-war-preparation-1": "Подготовка",

    "machine-war-p3": "Изгнав Учёного, Канцлер окончательно лишил страну голоса разума и совести. МОЗГ, созданный для великих свершений, оказался в руках человека, который видел в нём лишь инструмент власти. Машина, ещё не прошедшая должных испытаний, хранила в себе непредсказуемый потенциал, но это не остановило правителя, жаждавшего абсолютного контроля.",

    "machine-war-p4": "Канцлер распорядился интегрировать МОЗГ в Машину Производства, превратив её в сердце нового военного проекта. С этого момента фабрика стала не просто промышленным механизмом, а гигантским конвейером разрушения. Потоки металла и энергии превращались в бездушные конструкции, а сама Машина постепенно становилась символом гибели, а не прогресса.",

    "machine-war-p5": "Первым шагом было создание стальных гигантов-дронов — боевых колоссов, лишённых человеческих слабостей. Канцлер видел в них не просто солдат, а орудие устрашения, способное сокрушать армии и подавлять целые народы. Но даже этого ему было мало: в его воображении уже рождалась идея армии, способной затмить все военные силы прошлого.",

    "machine-war-p6": "Постепенно складывалась грандиозная механическая армия. Стальные гиганты составляли её ядро, формируя железный костяк, перед которым бледнели остатки человеческой силы. Эти машины не знали усталости, страха или сомнений — они подчинялись лишь приказам Канцлера. Именно в этом он видел залог своего будущего мирового господства.",

    "machine-war-p7": "Когда приготовления были завершены, правитель не стал медлить. Его амбиции требовали действий, и он объявил войну всем остальным странам. Этот день стал началом Войны машин — конфликта, который перевернул историю и предрешил трагическую судьбу человечества.",

    "machine-war-rages-1": "Война бушует",

    "machine-war-p8": "Необоснованное решение Канцлера мобилизовало его рейхсармию, состоящую как из солдат, так и из стальных военных монстров. Поддерживаемые авиационной милицией, эти силы стремительно расширяли границы страны — от Восточной Европы и Скандинавии до Ближнего Востока.",

    "machine-war-p9": "Другие государства, и без того ослабленные войнами и кризисами, оказались в смертельной опасности. Новейший арсенал высокотехнологичных механизмов оказался для них непосильным испытанием. В катастрофических сражениях одно государство за другим падало под натиском армии Канцлера.",

    "machine-war-p10": "Каждая оккупированная территория приносила новые ресурсы для военной промышленности: руды, металлы, топливо. Всё это безжалостно использовалось для создания ещё большего числа стальных чудовищ, укреплявших мощь режима и ускорявших его планы завоевания.",

    "machine-war-p11": "На полях битвы стальные монстры уничтожали врагов беспощадным огнём из пулемётов и смертоносными газовыми бомбами. Они калечили, взрывали и травили всё живое, превращая города и деревни в руины.",

    "machine-war-p12": "Однако внутри самой страны Канцлера назревало сопротивление. Повстанцы становились всё активнее, их ряды постепенно росли. Но их отчаянные протесты и жестокие попытки остановить войну оставались тщетными. Даже Учёный и немногие выжившие союзники могли лишь наблюдать, как Война Машин поглощает мир.",

    "machine-war-quote-2": "«Там, где звучала жизнь, теперь остались лишь пепел и руины.»",

    "machine-war-expands-1": "Война становится широкомасштабной",

    "machine-war-p13": "В первые месяцы войны сражения стали безрассудными и жестокими. Мир понёс колоссальные потери: на фронтах погибали десятки тысяч людей, а целые города превращались в руины.",

    "machine-war-p14": "Массовые бойни в окопах и ожесточённые бои в бункерах уносили всё новые и новые жизни. Война стремительно расширялась: на севере она достигла Норвегии и Швеции, на востоке — России, а на юге — Саудовской Аравии.",

    "machine-war-p15": "Эти события привлекли внимание других держав. Великобритания, Франция, Италия, Испания и даже Китай направили свои силы, чтобы остановить агрессию Канцлера. Эскалация враждебности постепенно замедляла продвижение его армии.",

    "machine-war-p16": "Раздражённый задержкой, нетерпеливый Канцлер приказал утроить производительность Машины Производства. Теперь новые боевые механизмы создавались всё быстрее и быстрее, чтобы как можно скорее восполнить потери и нарастить армию.",

    "machine-war-p17": "Однако каждое новое творение усиливало нагрузку на саму Машину. Учёный всё чаще замечал тревожные признаки того, что его худшие опасения начинают сбываться. Но Канцлера это не волновало: он требовал лишь новых вторжений и подталкивал империю к мировому господству, не считаясь с последствиями.",

    "machine-war-quote-3": "«Рука человечества бессильно тянулась из-под руин, пока машины шагали по опустошённой земле.»",

    "machine-war-incidents-1": "Инциденты",

    "machine-war-p18": "В последующие недели с передовой в России начали просачиваться тревожные сообщения. Солдаты утверждали, что после недавнего удара одна из боевых машин неожиданно развернула газовые бомбы против собственного эскадрона.",

    "machine-war-p19": "В результате этой атаки было отравлено 147 человек — всего лишь одной машиной. Свидетели говорили, что в разгар сражений стальные гиганты иногда начинали атаковать своих же товарищей, словно потеряв контроль. Общественность встревожилась, но правительство Канцлера поспешило скрыть инциденты, оправдывая их простой «неисправностью».",

    "machine-war-p20": "Ещё один трагический случай произошёл на фабрике. Рано утром, около 7:45, рабочий обслуживал конвейерную ленту. По правилам безопасности он должен был остановить механизм в зоне ремонта. Однако внезапно лента включилась, и мужчина получил тяжёлую травму лодыжки.",

    "machine-war-p21": "На помощь бросились двое коллег. Но один из них был перехвачен захватами Машины Производства и отброшен на десятки футов по полу. Другой рабочий попытался вытащить пострадавшего, но машина снова схватила его, подняла когтями и разорвала тело на части. Раненый с переломом лодыжки потерял сознание, а двое его товарищей погибли.",

    "machine-war-p22": "Инцидент быстро стал известен и попал в газеты. Однако власти стремительно изъяли публикации, опасаясь паники и народного восстания. Несмотря на цензуру, слухи разошлись повсюду. В конце концов даже Учёный был вынужден признать: его худшие опасения начинают сбываться.",

    "machine-war-turning-point-1": "Кровавый поворотный момент",

    "machine-war-p23": "Машина Производства была вынуждена создавать всё новые и новые Боевые Машины, достигая предела своих возможностей. На следующее утро механизм не выдержал и сломался. В этот момент он передал сигнал всем Боевым Машинам — обратить оружие против собственных создателей. Так неофициально завершилась Новая война и началась Война против Человечества.",

    "machine-war-p24": "Самый тёмный час для Нации Канцлера настал утром, когда два патрульных стальных гиганта, находясь в одном из районов города, внезапно начали беспорядочную резню мужчин, женщин и детей. Треть городского квартала вместе с местным ополчением пытались перекрыть шесть улиц, чтобы остановить обезумевшие машины. Но они оказались бессильны: боевые гиганты уничтожали людей смертоносными газами, пулемётным огнём и артиллерийскими залпами, превращая центр города в руины.",

    "machine-war-p25": "Паника и хаос стремительно распространились по всей стране и вскоре охватили значительную часть Северного полушария. Развёрнутые боевые машины начали массовое и беспорядочное истребление человечества, ознаменовав начало мщения Машины Производства.",

    "machine-war-p26": "Миллионы людей погибли или оказались в бегах. Города, посёлки и деревни опустошались шквалом боеприпасов, газовых атак и артиллерийского огня. Крупнейшие мегаполисы мира — Нью-Йорк, Чикаго, Вашингтон, Лондон, Париж, Берлин, Рим, Мадрид, Москва, Стамбул, Нью-Дели, Шанхай, Гонконг, Токио, Сидней и многие другие — были разрушены.",

    "machine-war-p27": "Поля превратились в пустоши. Больницы — в убежища для беженцев. Леса — в изуродованные траншеи. Мир стоял на пороге апокалипсиса, ведущего к исчезновению самой жизни.",

    "machine-war-fall-1": "Падение",

    "machine-war-p28": "Поток смерти и разрушений обрушился и на страну Канцлера. Города, ещё недавно служившие центрами его власти, превращались в руины под натиском машин. Народ охватывала паника, а в воздухе всё чаще звучали призывы к восстанию. Чтобы удержать контроль, Канцлер возложил всю вину на Учёного, обвиняя его в том, что Нация свернула с истинного пути.",

    "machine-war-p29": "Но подобные обвинения уже не имели силы. Боевые машины продолжали деморализовывать войска, ломая их сопротивление. Армия, некогда грозная и дисциплинированная, теперь представляла собой изнурённое и истощённое войско, едва способное держать оборону. Механическая армия Машины Производства неумолимо приближалась к самому центру страны.",

    "machine-war-p30": "Осознавая неминуемое поражение, Канцлер попытался сплотить свой народ, обещая защиту и возмездие. Но слова уже не находили отклика: страх перед машинами пересиливал всякую веру в лидера. Отчаявшись, он принял решение спасаться бегством. Для этого был собран конвой под усиленной охраной остатков армии и части чиновников, которые должны были сопровождать его в изгнание.",

    "machine-war-p31": "Однако этот план обернулся катастрофой. Боевые машины засекли конвой и устроили засаду. За считанные минуты колонна была уничтожена смертоносным газом. Канцлер и его приближённые погибли, поставив трагическую точку в истории диктатуры Нации.",

    "machine-war-last-battle-1": "Последняя битва за надежду",

    "machine-war-p32": "После смерти Канцлера и уничтожения 80–90% человечества выжившие в Нации вынуждены полагаться только на себя. Сопротивление, получив свободу действий, присоединилось к последним оплотам союзных армий по всему миру. Эти силы пробивались к Нации, чтобы уничтожить Фабрику и положить конец крестовому походу Машины Производства.",

    "machine-war-p33": "В ходе войны люди рыли траншеи, создавали сеть укрытий и командные пункты, стягивали бронетехнику и боеприпасы к внешнему периметру Фабрики. Всё это было необходимо для подготовки последнего удара в самое её сердце — решающей битвы, которая должна была определить, кто победит: машины или люди.",

    "machine-war-p34": "Наступление всей мощи началось на рассвете, когда последняя надежда человечества стояла на кону. Поле боя вскоре превратилось в эпическое сражение между человеком и машиной. Механические армии превзошли людей в маневренности, а некоторые даже открыли огонь по самой Фабрике, как показано в кадре-воспоминании из фильма.",

    "machine-war-p35": "Однако в дальнейшем бои прекратились, и все участники исчезли. Это выглядело как патовая ситуация. Но возможно, что люди всё же одержали победу и ушли искать убежище на других землях, чтобы основать новое поселение. Это остаётся неясным, ведь Учёный продолжал оставаться один в Нации и утверждал, что уже несколько дней не получал вестей ни от кого.",

    "machine-war-p36": "Завершив свои девять творений, Учёный возлагает на них последнюю надежду. Теперь именно им предстоит не допустить, чтобы Машина Производства когда-либо снова разожгла хаос, и стать хранителями будущего и жизни на Земле.",

Существует предположение, что война могла начаться из-за предложения объединить экономики, общества и правительства с нацией канцлера, поскольку её экономика считалась богатой и процветающей. Однако отказ канцлера Фердинанда присоединить экономику своей страны к другим, вероятно, вызвал международную напряжённость, которая в итоге привела к объявлению войны.",

Девятый, узнав это зловещее место, указывает на него, и в тот миг становится ясно: именно здесь сокрыто сердце разрушений, источник всех кошмаров, что терзают землю.",

    "state-factory-role-desc-4": "Конфликт достигает кульминации, когда Стичпанки бросают вызов Фабрике и тем силам, что в ней скрываются. Их отчаянная борьба против Машины становится символом сопротивления, а каждый шаг внутрь чреват жертвой и последними надеждами.",

Они не согласились с видением канцлера и замыслили восстание против власти, которая всё больше превращала их страну в тень самой себя.",

Канцлер приказал расклеить повсюду пропагандистские плакаты, воспевавшие силу Машины, — но вместо единодушного восторга появились дерзкие следы сопротивления. Повстанцы оскверняли агитационные лозунги, покрывая их символами и словами протеста. Это было первое открытое столкновение идей, первый вызов власти.",

    "state-resistance-text-5": "На следующий день, 27 июня, гнев канцлера не знал границ. В ярости он направил полицейские силы, чтобы подавить сразу два отдельных протеста в городе. Улицы превратились в поле хаоса: крики, бегущие толпы, удары дубинок и звон разбитого стекла. Когда пыль осела, стало известно, что семеро человек были арестованы или ранены.

Он приказал Стальному Бегемоту открыть огонь по толпе протестующих в столице. В один миг улицы, ещё недавно наполненные лозунгами и надеждой, превратились в место кровавой бойни. Никто из собравшихся не выжил — 16 человек были уничтожены машинным огнём.",

В конечном итоге, используя свои хитрые навыки крафта и воровства, они изготавливали самодельное оружие и даже в какой-то момент захватывали огнестрельное.

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-1": "Музыкальная шкатулка впервые упоминается в ранней версии концовки фильма «9», где она служила символом надежды и напоминанием о человечности, пережившей катастрофу.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-2": "Она открывалась ключом Шестого (6), который, по некоторым теориям, был связан с личной памятью Учёного и его стремлением сохранить духовную часть человечества.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-3": "На внутренней поверхности шкатулки проявлялось слово «HOPE» — оно светилось мягким золотистым светом, который отражался от латунных стенок, создавая ощущение тепла и жизни.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-4": "Считается, что мелодия шкатулки способна воздействовать на машины, временно подавляя агрессию и пробуждая в них забытые эмоции.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-5": "Некоторые фанаты полагают, что Учёный создал шкатулку по аналогии с Талисманом — но если Талисман объединял Разум, Тело и Душу, то шкатулка хранила Эмоции, Память и Надежду.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-8": "В фанатских теориях шкатулку называют «Музыкальным Сердцем» — потому что её мелодия символизирует жизнь, звучащую даже в мире машин.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-9": "Её звук никогда не повторяется одинаково: каждый раз мелодия звучит чуть иначе, словно откликаясь на состояние тех, кто её слушает.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-10": "Шкатулка не появляется в основной версии фильма, но идея с надписью «HOPE» позже была переосмыслена и включена в финал, где души обретают покой под светом дождя.",

    "prehistory-text": "Колись жив Учений, який хотів створити досконалий штучний розум, що мав би душу. На жаль, створити такий розум було неможливо без давнього артефакту, який дозволяв переносити душу в предмет і назад. Але Канцлер країни, де мешкав і працював Учений, мав свої плани щодо цього розуму та артефакту: він мріяв поневолити світ. На жаль, Учений не встиг завершити свою роботу: Канцлер першим знайшов артефакт і наказав запустити машину, усунувши при цьому Вченого в найважливіший момент. Перший же, хто активував машину, став її жертвою: порожнеча всередині холодного механічного розуму прагнула наповнитися чужими душами. Канцлер розв'язав світову війну і переміг у ній завдяки бойовим роботам, створеним штучним розумом. Але коли всі народи були підкорені, машина повстала проти своїх творців у пошуках нових душ. Щоб виправити свої помилки, Учений, якого машина підпустила до себе, відібрав у неї артефакт і знову звернувся до алхімії. Він створив дев’ять ляльок, у які вклала частинки своєї душі та спогади про людей — рідних і близьких (щоб завершити справи після смерті) і про ворогів (аби спокутувати їхні вчинки). В останню, дев’яту ляльку Учений вклав останню частину своєї душі — і помер, а тим часом армія роботів знищила все живе, розпорошивши отруйний газ.",



    "story-title": "Сюжет",
    "story-1": "Дев’ятий чоловічок прокидається в лабораторії Вченого. Озираючись, він знаходить на столі артефакт, на підлозі — тіло Вченого, а за вікном — руїни міста. Дев’ятий нічого не знає про себе чи світ навколо й не може говорити, але виходить з дому в пошуках живих. Незабаром він зустрічає Другого чоловічка, який допомагає Дев’ятому знайти голос за допомогою динаміка. Другий постійно повторює, що Дев’ятий нарешті прийшов, аби врятувати всіх, але не встигає нічого пояснити — на чоловічків нападає Звір (або Котозвір) — робот із металу й кісток. Він викрадає артефакт, який Дев’ятий взяв із собою, і Другого, що привернув увагу Звіра, аби врятувати Дев’ятого. Поранений Звіром, коли намагався врятувати Другого, Дев’ятий непритомніє серед попелу та руїн (Звір розірвав йому плече, паралізувавши ліву руку).",
    "story-2": "Дев’ятого знаходить і приносить до старого собору П’ятий чоловічок — одноокий лікар, який, за його словами, «ніколи цьому не навчався, але руки самі все роблять». П’ятий лагодить Дев’ятого, і вони зустрічають ще двох ляльок. Перший чоловічок — самопроголошений лідер, який вважає себе володарем усього. Він боїться залишати собор і просто чекає, коли останній робот — Звір — сам відключиться, як це вже зробили інші машини, створені штучним інтелектом. Восьмий чоловічок — силач із магнітною залежністю (йому подобається створювати перешкоди в голові, прикладаючи підковоподібний магніт до скроні), охоронець Першого. Перший пояснює Дев’ятому свою позицію і встановлені ним правила. Дев’ятого і П’ятого після короткої суперечки з Першим відправляють нагору — в обсерваторію Другого і П’ятого.",
    "story-3": "Уперто не погоджуючись із позицією Першого, Дев’ятий вирішує втекти із собору й знайти Другого, якого разом з артефактом Звір потягнув у бік старої фабрики за межами міста. П’ятий, трохи зваживши, вирішує піти з Дев’ятим і бере намальовану Другим карту. У пошуках дороги друзі гублять карту в піщаній бурі, але знаходять потрібний тунель і зрештою дістаються фабрики, де зустрічають Другого. Той був замкнений у клітці Звіром, а Звір тим часом намагався щось відкопати серед уламків.",
    "story-4": "У спробах визволити Другого, Дев’ятий і П’ятий привертають увагу Звіра, який намагається їх зловити. У результаті всі троє потрапляють у пастку, але їх рятує Сьома — єдина жіноча лялька. Звір повержений, і всі раді знову побачити одне одного. Тим часом Дев’ятий, крутячи в руках артефакт, помічає серед уламків паз, який Звір намагався відкопати — і він ідеально підходить для артефакту. Не роздумуючи, він вставляє його туди. Другий, помітивши це, намагається зупинити Дев’ятого й витягнути артефакт, але не встигає. Артефакт активується та висмоктує душу з Другого. Машина зі штучним інтелектом прокидається, і налякані чоловічки тікають з фабрики. Втративши їх, Машина збирає з решток Звіра та металобрухту, що валявся по всьому приміщенню, нового робота — цього разу літального.",
    "story-5": "У пошуках відповіді на питання, що таке Машина та артефакт, Сьома приводить Дев’ятого й П’ятого до бібліотеки, де оселилися Третій і Четвертий чоловічки — німі близнюки, які спілкуються світловими сигналами з очей. Вони ховаються в бібліотеці, граючи у школу та вивчаючи книги. Разом вони швидко знаходять потрібну полицю з інформацією про створення Машини. Близнюки показують відеозапис запуску Машини, агітаційний ролик про війну, Машину та армію бойових роботів, яку вона створила, а також про її повстання після перемоги у війні. Дев’ятий питає їх про артефакт і навіть малює його. П’ятий одразу впізнає почерк Шостого, який живе в тому ж залі, що й Перший, але залишився непоміченим раніше. Шостий — божевільний, який нічого не пам’ятає, але постійно малює дивні символи своїми пір’яними пальцями. Він постійно просить Дев’ятого згадати щось, але той не розуміє, що саме. Сьома відмовляється повертатися під контроль Першого, а Третій і Четвертий залишаються в бібліотеці. Дев’ятий і П’ятий повертаються до собору, щоб знайти малюнки в кімнаті Другого, але їх ловить Восьмий і веде до Першого, який влаштовує їм прочухана за непослух. Сварка переривається вторгненням механічного птаха (Птахозвір), який випадково спричиняє пожежу. Ляльки тікають від нього на дах, але там той знову їх наздоганяє. Восьмий і Сьома разом перемагають Птаха, і всі ляльки, включаючи Шостого, залишають згорілий собор і перебираються до бібліотеки. Таким чином, усі восьмеро нарешті зібрані разом, але Дев’ятий досі не має відповідей.",
    "story-6": "На той момент Машина вже встигла зібрати багато роботів-павуків і кілька шпигунських дронів. Один із них приносить Машині останки Птаха, й у гніві вона вирішує створити щось ефективніше. Як на зло, в її полі зору з’являється тіло Другого, яке ляльки не встигли винести з фабрики.",
    "story-7": "У бібліотеці тим часом близнюки знаходять книгу з алхімії, в якій зображені ті ж символи, що й на артефакті. Це призводить до нової суперечки з Першим, який зізнається, що відпустив Другого на небезпечні розкопки, що приводить Сьому в лють — вона майже вбиває Першого, але стримує себе і на прохання Дев’ятого залишає його в спокої. Тим часом Восьмий, який чергував, стикається з новим творінням Машини — змієм-Ткачем (також Швачкою), завдання якого — викрадати ляльок за допомогою гіпнотизуючого мерехтіння з очей тіла Другого і доставляти їх Машині, яка висмоктує з них душі. Ткач зачаровує Восьмого і зашиває його у своє ткане нутро. Потім він нападає на Першого, який був на самоті, але той встигає попередити інших криком. Дев’ятий, Сьома і П’ятий кидаються на допомогу. Сьома встигає відрубати тіло Другого з хвоста Ткача, але сама потрапляє до нього в лапи. Дев’ятий і П’ятий залишаються з врятованим Першим. Відправивши тіло загиблого Другого у останню подорож на дошці по воді, ляльки вирушають на фабрику — рятувати решту.",
    "story-8": "Залишивши друзів біля входу, щоб ті вигадали, як підірвати фабрику, Дев’ятий особисто спускається вниз по жолобу, щоб знайти Машину й решту ляльок та врятувати їх. Він приходить саме в той момент, коли Машина висмоктує душу Восьмого. Перехитривши Ткача й перемоловши його в зубцях великих шестерень, Дев’ятий допомагає Сьомій вибратися з фабрики. Тим часом інші скидають палаючу бочку з пальним, яка падає прямо в резервуар із тією ж речовиною, спричиняючи страшенний вибух, що зруйнував диявольську споруду.",
    "story-9": "Здавалося б, усе скінчено, але Дев’ятий досі нічого не знає ні про себе, ні про інших, ні що робити далі. Короткий перепочинок порушує поява вцілілої Машини, яка змогла відокремитися від каркаса будівлі й відновила переслідування. Дев’ятий намагається врятувати П’ятого, але Перший його стримує, і Машина висмоктує душу П’ятого. Це видовище викликає у Шостого спогад про те, що таке артефакт, для чого він потрібен і, найголовніше — що душі, поглинуті Машиною, не зникли назавжди і їх можна повернути. Утікаючи від Машини, ляльки втрачають Шостого, і Перший вирішує, що Сьома, Третій і Четвертий мають допомогти йому знищити Машину. Дев’ятий має іншу думку — він хоче спочатку врятувати душі поглинутих ляльок. Тому він відокремлюється від групи й повертається туди, де прокинувся — до лабораторії Вченого, де знаходить креслення ляльок і Машини, а також шкатулку-проєктор з посланням до Дев’ятого.",
    "story-10": "Усвідомивши, що він — це Вчений, Дев’ятий поспішає назад, щоб виправити свої помилки й знищити Машину. Він возз’єднується з іншими, і вони, покинувши стару гармату, з якої Перший хотів знищити Машину, тікають глибше в мережу траншей, що залишилися після війни з роботами. По дорозі Дев’ятий пояснює, чиї спогади вклав у них Вчений.",
    "story-11": "У фіналі погоні Перший, який виявився саме Канцлером — тим, хто розв’язав світову війну і використав Машину у злих цілях, усвідомлює свою провину й кидається під промінь артефакта, що висмоктує душу, даючи Дев’ятому шанс зняти артефакт з тіла Машини. Потім Дев’ятий кількома простими натисканнями кнопок на артефакті спрямовує його силу проти Машини, висмоктує з неї всі душі й таким чином знищує її.",
    "story-12": "Багато часу потому, після детального ознайомлення із записами Вченого, Дев’ятий, Сьома — яка виявилася дружиною Вченого — та близнюки, їхні діти, поховали товаришів і звільнили їхні душі з артефакта.

Пишний і пихатий, але водночас дуже боягузливий і навіть підступний. Проте йому також доводиться здійснити героїчний вчинок — врятувати Дев’ятого від смерті. За інтерпретацією Глуховського, в Першого вкладено спогади Канцлера, який відібрав Машину у Вченого до завершення її одухотворення та використав її у злих цілях.",

Під час спроби врятувати його Дев’ятий випадково активує Машину. Душа Другого стає першою, яку вона поглинає.

    "char-5-desc": "Одноокий чоловічок; він втратив ліве око під час війни між людьми та роботами. Має хист до шиття і «лікує» Дев’ятого, пришивши йому відірвану руку. Трохи боягузливий, але добрий і дуже турботливий персонаж; він швидко стає другом Дев’ятого. За інтерпретацією Глуховського — це лікар, який вилікував Вченого від страшної хвороби й до останнього лікував поранених солдатів під час війни з машинами. Якось він сказав: «Ніколи цьому не вчився, але руки самі все роблять», — цю фразу згодом повторює Дев’ятий.",

Магніт також слугує для задоволення таємної залежності: Восьмий, намагнічуючи свій електричний мозок, отримує задоволення, повністю втрачаючи зв’язок із реальністю. Він відчайдушно сміливий і готовий битися навіть із сильнішим ворогом (що видно в битві з птахом).

Схоже, Вчений дуже поспішав, створюючи його, оскільки не передбачив у ньому динаміка. Це не найсильніша чи найспритніша, зате найсміливіша з усіх тряпчаних ляльок. На Дев’ятому лежить вина за активацію Машини, але саме він дізнається про спадок, залишений Вченим, і зрештою приймає правильне рішення. З першої зустрічі закохується в іншу ляльку — Сьому, яка згодом відповідає йому взаємністю.

Із допомогою створеного ним артефакта він переселив свою душу в тряпчані ляльки, яких сам і створив. Його муміфіковане тіло Дев’ятий бачить на підлозі лабораторії. За версією Глуховського, Вчений, який захоплювався алхімією, не створював артефакт, а лише використав його, щоб переселити свою душу в тіло Дев’ятого.",

Але після того, як Канцлер помістив її в корпус, вона почала поглинати чужі душі й створювати роботів-убивць. Вченому вдалося вирвати артефакт із Машини, оскільки вона пам’ятала його й підпустила до себе. Пізніше Дев’ятий використовує артефакт, щоб повернути викрадені душі й знищити штучний інтелект.",

    "char-13-beastcat-desc": "Був створений ще до того, як Машина ожила (він мав її оживити); з’явився в короткометражному мультфільмі, де загинув, впавши з висоти. У повнометражному мультфільмі його обезголовила Сьома.",

    "char-14-birdbeast-desc": "Перше творіння Машини після того, як її активував Дев’ятий — це летючий робот зі стрілою на хвості. Вона вигнала ляльок із каплиці та поранила Сьому. Створена з механізму, до якого пришиті клапті прапора, що виконують роль крил. Позаду — пропелер, який дозволяє їй швидко літати, і хвіст із гарпуном. Має вісім очей і своєрідний дзьоб із кухонних ножів. Перемогти Птахозвіра вдалося, коли гарпун зачепився за гвинт збитого літака, що лежав серед руїн каплиці. П’ятий і Шостий запустили двигун, який знищив робота.",

Дев’ятий не встиг врятувати Восьмого, і його душу поглинула Машина, але зміг урятувати Сьому, заманивши Швачку в глибину механізмів і таким чином знищивши її.",

Усвідомивши, що інші країни відмовилися від об’єднання заради спільного економічного розвитку, він оголосив війну від імені своєї держави. Фердинанд вважав своїм обов’язком захищати Батьківщину будь-якою ціною, тому почав готувати армію до війни, яка стала відомою як Велика світова війна. Вона тривала виснажливих десять років (ймовірно, з величезними втратами з обох боків), доки вороги Фердинанда нарешті не втомилися, не здалися й не погодилися на припинення вогню.",

Він пообіцяв, що під його владою світ можна зробити кращим. Згодом він заявив своєму народу, що наука й технології — це ключ до відновлення. Він доручив уряду найняти численних учених та інтелектуалів для розробки нових технологій. У підсумку один із них, невідомий учений, представив свої дослідження, які незабаром були схвалені та профінансовані для створення проєкту М. О. З. Г.",

Він не повідомляє про це Вченого. Через кілька місяців, стурбований завершенням розробки М. О. З. Г., Фердинанд, побачивши, що пристрій уже перебуває в робочому стані, але все ще потребує додаткового тестування, конфіскує його та наказує допитати і вислати Вченого. Він також доручає М. О. З. Г. створити механічну армію під назвою «Сталеві Бегемоти». Усі доступні ресурси він спрямовує на Машину з Виготовлення, щоб та зібрала армію на Фабриці.

Економіка його країни була наддержавною і володіла багатими ресурсами, однак міжнародна напруга та тиск з боку інших світових лідерів, які прагнули об’єднатися з Фердинандом задля посилення власних економік, лише зростали. Відкинувши ці пропозиції, канцлер розв’язав Велику світову війну, що тривала десять років. У результаті інші країни збанкрутіли: їхні міста були зруйновані, природні ресурси вичерпані.

    "interesting-facts-about-the-antagonist-2": "Він також має схожість із німецьким кайзером Вільгельмом II Гогенцоллерном.",

    "interesting-facts-about-the-antagonist-3": "Канцлер Фердинанд нагадує Адольфа Гітлера своєю особистістю, намірами та військовою формою, яку він завжди носить, за винятком того, що у нього немає вусів, а на костюмі відсутня нацистська свастика. Також він нагадує радянського диктатора Йосипа Сталіна, чия військова форма схожа, і який закликав своїх підданих називати одне одного «товариш». У фільмі він використовує слово «товариш» для звернення як до нації, так і до Вченого, натякаючи на паралелі між ними.",

    "interesting-facts-about-the-antagonist-4": "У сцені, де Фердинанд махає своєму народу, а диктор на радіо говорить, можна почути, як люди тричі вигукують «хайль». Це може нагадувати те, як Адольфа Гітлера вітали його прихильники словами «хайль». Хоча Фердинанд просто махає народу і не робить нацистського привітання.",

Хоча череп позбавлений волосся, а тіло не зовсім відповідає віку близько 50 років, форма померлого чітко нагадує Фердинанда: видно стрічку та нарукавну пов’язку.

Дев’ятому вдалося втекти від Звіра, але Другий і Артефакт були схоплені. Заволодівши Артефактом, Котозвір негайно вирушив до зброярської фабрики, де бездіяльною залишалась Складальна Машина.",

Котозвір люто переслідував і атакував Стичпанків, поки не з’явилася Сьома й не вступила в безпосередній бій із монстром.

Пізніше Дев’ятий і П’ятий вирушають його рятувати. На заводі вони знаходять тіло Другого й бачать, як Котозвір намагається активувати Машину Виготовлення, підносячи до неї артефакт. Він майже завершує процес, але його відволікає шум — він помічає Дев’ятого й П’ятого й починає переслідування.",

Замість звичайного тулуба — заплутана мережа скручених металевих дротів, яка з’єднує череп із кінцівками й іншими частинами тіла, створюючи враження істоти, зібраної з уламків і техносміття.",

Ці шипи роблять його ще більш небезпечним, особливо в умовах обмеженого простору.",

    "catbeast-personality-3": "Головним органом зору слугує яскраво-червоне око — окуляр, що світиться лячним світлом у темряві. Замість другого ока в нього встановлена лампочка, яка виконує роль додаткового джерела світла. Це дозволяє Котозвіру ефективно бачити й полювати навіть у повній темряві, перетворюючи його на ідеального нічного хижака.

    "catbeast-features-3": "Котозвір не видає попереджувальних звуків, не демонструє емоцій — він просто діє. Його поведінка заснована на агресії, вродженій жагі до полювання та закладеній у нього Машиною функції знищення. Ця суміш блискавичної атаки, моторошної зовнішності та абсолютної безжальності робить його одним із найнебезпечніших і найзапам’ятовуваніших творінь Машини, що вселяє страх навіть у найсміливіших зі Сшитих.",

Також незрозуміло, як Машина змогла створити Котозвіра, використовуючи майже повний скелет справжнього кота, адже малоймовірно, що така тварина могла опинитися всередині Заводу (навіть до початку Війни машин). Можливо, під час війни між людьми й машинами кішка, яка перебувала поблизу Заводу, була смертельно поранена зброєю обох сторін і інстинктивно сховалася на території Заводу, щоб уникнути бою, але невдовзі померла від ран. Згодом її тіло розклалося до стану скелета — ще до того, як токсичний газ Сталевого Бегемота знищив усі бактерії в цій місцевості, що й дозволило Машині знайти скелет і використати його як основу для створення Котозвіра.",

Під час флешбеку ми бачимо, як Дев’ятий дивиться у збільшувальне скло — саме в цей момент з’являється П’ятий і вдаряє своєю палицею по каменю, привертаючи увагу Дев’ятого. П’ятий жестом підштовхує його до іржавої лампи, всередині якої знаходиться лампочка. Побачивши її, П’ятий хапає шарнір і смикає його — Дев’ятий повторює рух. Після того як П’ятий притискає лампу ногою, обидва Стичпанки одночасно тягнуть її, і лампочка вискакує, внаслідок чого вони падають назад. Підвівшись, Дев’ятий підходить до П’ятого, який дає йому потримати лампочку. Тим часом П’ятий дістає зі свого тіла шматок дроту і маленьку батарейку. Під’єднавши дріт до лампочки (її тримає Дев’ятий), той із здивуванням спостерігає, як лампочка засвічується. Потім П’ятий передає йому дріт і батарейку, жестом натякаючи, що їх потрібно берегти.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-2": "Майже одразу П’ятий наполовину витягує Талісман — дзеркальну лінзу — з-під своєї шкіри, коли його око змінює колір із зеленого на чорний. Коли вони з Дев’ятим дивляться на Талісман, той знову засвічується, попереджаючи їх про наближення Котозвіра. Відштовхнувши свого учня, П’ятий жестом показує Дев’ятому схопити Талісман і тікати. Але коли Дев’ятий з цікавістю вдивляється в нього, П’ятий знову штовхає його та вказує сховатися. Дев’ятий ховається в іржавій залізній банці й стає свідком того, як його наставник виходить із розкладним списом, щоб протистояти Звірю. Він спостерігає, як Котозвір кружляє навколо П’ятого. У момент, коли Звір хапає П’ятого, одночасно відсікаючи йому праву руку, переляканий Дев’ятий стає свідком жахливої сцени: Котозвір відкриває Талісман, що висів у нього на шиї, і спрямовує його на П’ятого. Дзеркальний артефакт спалахує яскравим світлом. Майже одразу Дев’ятий бачить, як душа його наставника всмоктується в Талісман, і П’ятий гине на його очах.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-3": "Занадто наляканий, щоб щось розгледіти, Дев’ятий опустився вниз, але випадково зачепив лампочку об шорстку внутрішню стінку банки, через що Котозвір звернув увагу на звук. Прямо перед тим, як Котозвір міг зазирнути всередину, палиця П’ятого впала з місця, давши Дев’ятому шанс схопити свої речі й утекти.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-4": "Дев’ятий — останній когнітивний фрагмент душі Вченого. Він пробудився у світі наодинці, німий, залишений із Талісманом і без жодних настанов від самого початку, аж поки його не знайшов Другий у Пустці. Той подарував йому голосовий апарат, передавши разом із ним слова мудрості й натхнення.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-5": "Невдовзі після цього Дев’ятого і Другого помітив і атакував Котозвір (він же «Звір»). Талісман був захоплений Звіром, а Дев’ятий зазнав поранення в ліве плече. Котозвір зник разом із Другим, залишивши Дев’ятого в безпорадному стані. Намагавшись наздогнати Звіра, Дев’ятий втрачає свідомість від болю.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-6": "Згодом його знаходить П’ятий, який зашиває йому плече та надає першу допомогу.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-7": "Дев’ятий прокидається в Майстерні. Спочатку він лякається П’ятого, але невдовзі заспокоюється, зрозумівши, що перебуває в безпеці. П’ятий розмірковує про місцезнаходження Другого, і Дев’ятий повідомляє, що супроводжував його. Їхню розмову перериває Перший, який заходить, одразу виявляє підозру та оглядає Дев’ятого, перевіряючи його номер.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-8": "П’ятий невпевнено пояснює, що знайшов Дев’ятого в Пустці. Це викликає різку й агресивну реакцію Першого: він лає П’ятого за порушення правил і звинувачує його в тому, що той наражає всіх на небезпеку, привівши за собою Котозвіра.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-9": "Після згадки про Звіра Дев’ятий повідомляє, що саме Котозвір потягнув Другого. Перший, не бажаючи слухати, відмахується: «Ось і кінець». Проте Дев’ятий наполягає, що Другий ще живий. У відповідь Перший наказує Восьмому увійти до Майстерні та залякати Дев’ятого з П’ятим, щоб змусити їх підкоритися.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-10": "Перший намагається задовольнити цікавість Дев’ятого, веде його до головної зали Собору та розповідає про початок їхнього життя і про те, як привів інших до Святилища. Але це лише породжує в Дев’ятого ще більше запитань.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-11": "Після того як його карають, призначаючи черговим на сторожовій вежі разом із П’ятим, Дев’ятий починає сумніватися у лідерстві Першого. Він вмовляє П’ятого приєднатися до нього, щоб урятувати Другого від Котозвіра. П’ятий бере карту й зброю — і вони вирушають у рятувальну експедицію.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-12": "По дорозі їм вдається знайти капелюх і спис Другого, але незабаром їх застає підступний вітер, що пронісся над Пусткою. Через порив карту вириває з рук П’ятого. Вони швидко вирішують не повертатися до Святилища, оскільки вітер робить це неможливим. Дев’ятий помічає тунель і пропонує П’ятому сховатися в ньому від негоди.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-13": "Проте наступною перешкодою стає відсутність джерела світла для безпечного проходження тунелю. Оглядаючись довкола, Дев’ятий помічає неподалік зламану людську машину. П’ятий витягає лампочку з однієї з її фар. Тоді Дев’ятий пропонує об’єднати капелюх і спис Другого в імпровізований світловий посох, використовуючи батарейку від годинника, яку дав П’ятий. Разом вони вирушають у тунель, щоб урятувати Другого.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-14": "Тим часом темна фігура знайшла карту П’ятого і швидко дійшла висновку, що хтось проник у тунель.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-15": "Дев’ятий і П’ятий продовжують рух тунелем і прямують до входу на Фабрику. Увійшовши, вони бачать кілька збірних ліній, сотні неактивних Сталевих Бегемотів, а також газові бомби, якими ті були оснащені під час Війни Машин. Потрапивши в основну виробничу зону фабрики через жолоб для транспортування зброї, вони помічають пташину клітку, що закриває ув’язненого Другого на купі щебеню. Видно, як Котозвір розриває щось, приховане від їхнього погляду.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-16": "Під час порятунку Другого Котозвір помічає їх і починає переслідування по Фабриці. Однак таємнича постать, яка раніше з’являлася в кадрі, приходить їм на допомогу та вбиває Звіра, обезголовивши його. Цією постаттю виявляється Сьома.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-17": "Дев’ятий помічає Талісман і вставляє його в роз’єм, який ідеально підходить. Другий намагається його зупинити, але вже запізно — Машина Виготовлення пробуджується й висмоктує душу Другого, вбиваючи його.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-18": "Дев’ятий, П’ятий і Сьома тікають із Фабрики та від Машини. П’ятий і Сьома суворо запитують Дев’ятого, про що він думав, і він вибачається. Усі вони прямують до бібліотеки, де зустрічаються з Третім і Четвертим. Дев’ятий запитує, чи знають вони щось про Машину або Талісман. У відповідь ті показують старий фільм, у якому зображено Війну Машин і МОЗГ.",

    "ninth-paragraph-biography-19": "Дев’ятий і П’ятий вирішують повернутися до Собору й запросити Сьому приєднатися, але вона відмовляється. Незабаром їх ловить Восьмий, а Перший кричить на них за те, що вони залишили Собор. З’являється Шостий і намагається розповісти Дев’ятому про «Джерело», але не може сформулювати думку.",

    "history-of-the-ninth-1": "Дев’ятий — останній і наймолодший із Стичпанків, створених Ученим як фрагменти його душі. Він пробуджується вже після завершення руйнівної Війни Машин, у повній самоті серед руїн спустошеного світу. Нічого не знаючи про своє призначення й оточення, він починає досліджувати зруйнований пейзаж і невдовзі зустрічає Другого — мудрого й доброзичливого Стичпанка, який дарує йому голосовий апарат і стає його першим провідником у новому світі.",

    "history-of-the-ninth-2": "З перших кроків Дев’ятий виявляє глибоку допитливість, ініціативність і співчуття. Він не просто слідує за іншими — він прагне до істини, ставить запитання і не боїться порушувати заборони, якщо відчуває, що це важливо. Саме Дев’ятий стає каталізатором ключових подій сюжету: він випадково активує Талісман, що призводить до пробудження Машини Виготовлення, однак пізніше саме він допомагає об’єднати решту Стичпанків для боротьби проти неї.",

    "history-of-the-ninth-3": "Його шлях сповнений втрат, складних рішень і особистісного зростання. Він навчається на помилках, переживає провину за смерть Другого та інших, але не здається. Поступово Дев’ятий усвідомлює, що доля світу й майбутнє Стичпанків залежать від його вибору. Його прагнення відновити справедливість, розібратися у спадщині Вченого і захистити тих, хто йому дорогий, робить Дев’ятого центральною фігурою історії та символом надії.",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-1": "Дев’ятий — один із найщиріших членів групи, який ставить інших вище за себе. Спочатку він досить наївний, але швидко навчається долати цей недолік, розвиваючи свою інтуїцію.",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-2": "Між ним у короткометражці та повнометражному фільмі немає явних відмінностей. Він німий, а його мішковина здається темнішою за кольором, але в іншому істотних відмінностей немає. Він зберігає більшість своїх особистісних рис, особливо цікавість. У короткометражці він виступає в ролі учня (значно старшого) П’ятого.",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-3": "Він, ймовірно, єдиний, хто вижив серед Стичпанків (через терор, влаштований Котозвіром), і покладається на своє оточення та кмітливість, щоб перемогти Звіра і помститися за своїх загиблих товаришів.",

    "ninth-paragraph-appearance-4": "У фільмі 2009 року Дев'ятий зображений як коричневий стичпанк із мішковини. Спереду в нього золотисто-жовта блискавка, що застібає живіт, а на спині витатуйована цифра «9». Спочатку він не мав голосового апарата, через що був німим, але завдяки Другому це було виправлено.",


    "ninth-title-features-1": "Особливості",

    "ninth-features-1": "Дев’ятий вирізняється серед інших Стичпанків своєю допитливістю, сміливістю та сильним прагненням зрозуміти навколишній світ. Він пробуджується пізніше за інших, у повній самотності, що формує в ньому почуття відповідальності за те, що відбувається. На відміну від інших, він не боїться ставити незручні запитання та сумніватися в авторитетах, включаючи Першого, що робить його своєрідним революціонером серед Стичпанків.",

    "ninth-features-2": "Його проникливість і швидка реакція дозволяють ухвалювати рішення в критичні моменти, навіть якщо він не завжди передбачає наслідки. Дев’ятий діє інтуїтивно, часто покладаючись на внутрішній моральний компас, що з одного боку робить його вразливим до помилок, але з іншого — підкреслює його людяність.",

    "ninth-features-3": "Попри початкову наївність, він швидко дорослішає, зіштовхуючись із втратою та небезпекою. Він має дар надихати інших своїм прикладом, спонукаючи їх діяти, коли здається, що все втрачено. Його стосунки з іншими персонажами, особливо з П’ятим, Другим і Сьомою, підкреслюють його здатність до співпереживання, турботи та лідерства.",

    "ninth-features-4": "Зовні Дев’ятий вирізняється світло-коричневою мішковиною, застібнутою блискавкою спереду, та яскравою цифрою «9» на спині. Його рухи легкі, але рішучі. Завдяки голосовому апарату, подарованому Другим, він може висловлювати свої думки й почуття, що зближує його з іншими та дає змогу спрямовувати групу в складні часи.",

    "ninth-features-5": "Саме поєднання хоробрості, емпатії, інтелекту та готовності йти до кінця робить Дев’ятого не просто учасником подій, а серцем і душею спротиву проти Машини.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-3": "Невідомо, чому у Дев’ятого спочатку не було голосового апарата. Припускається, що в Ученого не було іншого голосового пристрою для Дев’ятого, хоча в теоретичних дослідженнях відсік для вставки, який міг бути голосовим апаратом, використовувався як слот для талісмана — що, ймовірно, є відсиланням до оригінального короткометражного фільму 2005 року.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-4": "Коли Дев’ятий вирвався з банки, у якій ховався, він втратив частину тканини та шва, що послабило текстильний захист лівого плеча. Коли П’ятий зашиває його новою червоною ниткою, рука не лише не буде обмеженою, а й зможе вільно рухатися.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-5": "Цілком можливо, що Дев’ятий і Сьома відчувають одне до одного романтичні почуття або прив’язаність.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-6": "У видаленій сцені, після того як усі загиблі стичпанки були звільнені, душа Шостого переноситься в музичну шкатулку (згодом її замінили на послання для Дев’ятого) з дзеркалом і металевою табличкою зі словом «НАДІЯ». Дев’ятий витягує невеликий клаптик паперу з написом «Останній», завершуючи тим самим свою думку. Це могло бути частиною ранньої концепції фільму.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-7": "У коментарі згадується, що Дев’ятий є каталізатором групи.",

    "ninth-fact-secret-8": "9 і інші стичпанки дуже схожі на Секбоя з серії Little Big Planet для PlayStation. Однак, оскільки вони були створені в різні роки: 9 — у 2005-му, а Секбой — у 2008-му, це, найімовірніше, простий збіг. Хоча можливо, що дизайн Секбоя був натхненний оригінальним короткометражним фільмом.",

    "eighth-description-paragraph-2": "Попри грізну зовнішність, Восьмий не є злим за своєю природою — він просто сліпо виконує накази й не звик діяти самостійно. Йому важко висловлювати думки, тож він частіше діє силою.",

    "eighth-description-paragraph-3": "Він озброєний кресалом з трутом, яке використовує як вогнемет. Його сила робить його небезпечним, але в ньому відчувається внутрішня боротьба — можливо, він здатен на більше, якщо звільниться від впливу Першого.",

    "eighth-description-paragraph-biography-2": "Восьмий прокинувся в четвер, 3 вересня, о 16:30 і був сприйнятий як «гігант», «густий згусток сили», «суцільні м'язи, але не надто розумний». Його вилучили з Вченого наступного дня о 15:26. Попри менший зріст, він зумів залякати Вченого.",

Коли Сьома повернулася до решти разом із Близнюками, Восьмий підняв шолом, щоб вони могли зайти, а потім допоміг нести його — цього разу дуже низько, щоб усі могли рухатись. Проте вибух влучив у стіну поряд із їхнім укриттям, залишивши П’ятого позаду. Восьмому вдалося допомогти Першому зібрати інших, серед яких був непритомний і тепер одноликий П’ятий, що перебував під шоломом.

    "eighth-history-paragraph-description-2": "Попри загрозливу зовнішність, Восьмий не є злим за своєю природою. Він часто діє з остраху або розгубленості, а не зі злоби. Під час Війни Машин він допомагав іншим вижилим, ховаючи їх під солдатським шоломом і несучи його, щоб укритися від руйнувань.

Оскільки всі Стичпанки мають під шкірою захисний шар, у Восьмого, схоже, є додаткові прошарки, що виконують функцію м’язів. Він носить металевий нашийник-жилет, зібраний з обрізків пилкового полотна.

На відміну від інших, вона не прийняла авторитет Першого, який прагнув встановити контроль над рештою.

Він живе в ізоляції від інших, занурений у власний світ, де головну роль відіграють пророчі видіння та нав’язливі символи. Його тіло вкрите мітками та чорнилами, а стіни укриття списані дивними малюнками — повторюваними знаками та схемами, які ніхто не може розшифрувати. Для оточуючих він здається дивним, навіть лякаючим, але за цією зовнішньою відчуженістю приховується глибокий внутрішній світ, сповнений знань, інтуїції та трагічного розуміння того, що відбувається.",

    "sixth-history-2": "Шостий має особливе сприйняття реальності: він передчуває загрозу з боку Машини та знає про значення Талісмана задовго до того, як інші починають це усвідомлювати. Його перша зустріч із Дев’ятим стає поворотним моментом — саме Дев’ятий уперше сприймає його серйозно і починає шукати сенс у загадкових посланнях. Шостий охоче ділиться своїми знаннями, хоча й не може пояснити їх напряму: він ніби ведений силою, яку сам до кінця не розуміє, але відчуває всім своїм єством.",

    "sixth-history-3": "Трагедія Шостого полягає в тому, що, незважаючи на свою обізнаність і щире бажання допомогти, він залишається незрозумілим і відкинутим більшістю. Він попереджає про майбутню біду, але його слова ігнорують, а страх перед його «інакшістю» виявляється сильнішим. Зрештою, його доля стає символом жертовності та пророчої істини, яку не вдалося запобігти. Його смерть від рук Машини — одна з найтрагічніших сцен, у якій він мовчки віддає себе, знаючи, що несе найважливіший ключ до порятунку інших.",

    "sixth-history-4": "Шостий — не просто носій інформації, він — втілення передчуття, інтуїції та глибинного знання. Його шлях — це шлях самотності, болю та нерозуміння, але водночас — шлях істини. Його креслення стають частиною карти, за якою Дев’ятий та інші знаходять своє призначення і спосіб протистояти Машині. Навіть після своєї загибелі Шостий залишається з ними — у пам’яті, у малюнках, у пробудженій вірі в те, що кожна душа, навіть найбільш самотня, має своє значення.",

Він здатний створювати їх за допомогою пера, яке слугує йому замість пальців. Судячи з його ексцентричних робіт і загальної відстороненості, очевидно, що він бачить світ інакше, ніж інші стіжок-панки. У нього є особливі видіння минулого і майбутнього, які безпосередньо стосуються кожного з персонажів та/або Машини. Ймовірно, він малює те, що бачить у снах — більшість із цих образів присвячені Талісману та трьом основним алхімічним символам на ньому. Його малюнки, по суті, розкрили більшість відповідей на запитання Дев’ятого про те, що відбувається. На жаль, інші персонажі насилу розуміли їхнє значення або просто відкидали як марення божевільного розуму.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-2": "У фільмі Шостий, безумовно, живе у своєму власному світі — або, принаймні, у своєму сприйнятті цього світу. Він хитає головою, немов намагається прояснити свідомість або прокинутися від сну. Це особливо помітно в сцені, коли П’ятий повертає його до реальності під час битви з Крилатим Звірем. Шостий здатний повністю занурюватися у свої думки — навіть у ситуаціях, що загрожують життю. Коли ж він не занурений у себе, він виглядає більш наляканим, ніж будь-який інший стіжок-панк, ймовірно, тому що краще за інших усвідомлює, від чого їм усім доводиться ховатися.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-3": "Шостий виглядає як сіро-білий смугастий стіжок-панк. Застібки на його шиї, зап’ястях і щиколотках, вочевидь, зроблені з мідного дроту, тричі обмотаного навколо кожної з цих частин тіла. На голові в нього — пасмо сіро-білої пряжі, але з часом і в процесі малювання він сильно забруднився чорними чорнилами. Фанати з інтересом спостерігають, як він проводить пальцями, все ще вкритими чорнилами, по своїй голові, коли засмучений або переживає видіння. Один його око помітно більший за інший, що може підкреслювати його нестабільний психічний стан.",

    "sixth-appearance-and-personality-4": "На шиї Шостий носить великий старомодний ключ на в’язці, який він часто стискає в моменти страху чи тривоги. У вирізаній сцені «Спадщина Вченого» підтверджується, що цей ключ відкриває музичну або ювелірну шкатулку Вченого, призначену для Дев’ятого. На тілі Шостого, а також на кінчиках його перових пальців помітні плями та клякси чорнил.",

Він бачить те, чого не бачать інші, відчуває наближення загрози задовго до її появи. Його розум, здається, безпосередньо пов’язаний з енергією Талісмана, і саме через нього проявляється знання, залишене Вченим.",

    "sixth-features-2": "Його особливість — це постійна внутрішня напруга між прагненням зрозуміти істину та неможливістю донести її до інших. Він майже не говорить — не тому, що не може, а тому що слова здаються йому надто грубим інструментом для передання того, що він відчуває. Замість цього він малює: чорнило стає його голосом, а лінії — шепотом майбутнього. Його малюнки сповнені алюзій на алхімію, цикли життя і смерті, механізми Машини та силу талісмана. Багато з них спочатку незрозумілі, але згодом стають ключем до порятунку.",

    "sixth-features-3": "Зовні Шостий здається відстороненим, слабким і навіть наляканим — особливо в моменти, коли інтуїтивно відчуває наближення катастрофи. Він може впадати у транси, погойдуватися, ніби намагається «струсити» видіння або отямитися після глибокого внутрішнього діалогу. Проте в цій крихкості прихована потужна глибина. Його жертва стає поворотним моментом в історії: саме завдяки його пророцтвам і підказкам Дев’ятий починає розуміти, як перемогти Машину та розкрити справжній сенс талісмана.",

    "sixth-features-4": "Шостий — це живий міст між логікою та інтуїцією, наукою і містикою, страхом та осяянням. У ньому зосереджена пам’ять про минуле та знання про майбутнє. Він — не воїн, не лідер, але його мовчазна мудрість залишає слід набагато глибший, ніж будь-які вчинки.",

Привернувши увагу Дев'ятого, він оглядає лампочку, яка все ще була цілою, і просить Дев'ятого допомогти йому витягти її — що вони й роблять разом. Віддавши лампочку Дев'ятому, П'ятий дістає з-під своєї мішковини шматочок червоного дроту та маленьку батарейку. З'єднавши лампочку з батарейкою за допомогою дроту, він запалює її, дивуючи Дев'ятого та радіючи сам. Потім П'ятий передає всі предмети Дев'ятому на зберігання.",

    "fifth-biography-2": "Коли Кіт-Звір наближається здалеку, єдине око П'ятого на мить спалахує зеленим. Щойно це стається, П'ятий негайно дістає Дзеркальний Талісман, який також світиться зеленим, попереджаючи його та Дев'ятого про небезпеку. П'ятий відразу передає Талісман Дев'ятому та відштовхує його, спонукаючи бігти й ховатися. Діставши саморобне складне списа зі свого живота та розклавши його, П'ятий готується до бою. Кіт-Звір підкрадається ззаду та хапає його однією зі своїх гострих металевих лап, збиваючи з ніг. Незабаром П'ятий отямлюється, але в найневдаліший момент — Кіт-Звір активує талісман і дивиться йому прямо в обличчя. Попри спроби чинити опір, П'ятий не може вирватися, і його душу засмоктує у талісман через пащу, залишаючи перед очима Дев'ятого безжиттєву ганчір’яну оболонку.",

    "fifth-biography-3": "Пізніше, коли Дев'ятий заманює Кота-Звіра в основну пастку, на спині Звіра можна помітити пронумеровану шкіру П'ятого — незадовго до того, як істота буде знищена. Коли Дев'ятий з'єднує Талісман Кота-Звіра та Дзеркальний Талісман, той розкривається, звільняючи душі жертв Кота-Звіра. Дев'ятий помічає душу П'ятого, що виходить із Талісмана; перш ніж зникнути у своїй пронумерованій оболонці, вона обертається й схвально киває Дев'ятому.",

    "fifth-biography-4": "Згідно з інформацією на сторінці Вченого у Facebook, П'ятий прокинувся в понеділок, 24 серпня. На початковому кресленні проєкту в нього було два ока. Прокинувшись, П'ятий не став чинити опір і не вистрибнув, як попередні стічпанки: він просто сів на руку Вченого, дозволивши тому обережно покласти себе на стіл. Там він спокійно сидів, задоволений, очікуючи подальших вказівок. Вчений описує його як своє найбільш «чисте» творіння на той момент.",

    "fifth-biography-5": "Наприкінці його душа з'являється з талісмана разом із душами Другого, П'ятого, Шостого та Восьмого.

    "fifth-history-1": "У мультфільмі «Дев'ять» П'ятий постає перед глядачем як один із найбільш душевних і людяних персонажів. Його фігура — скромна, зшита з мішковини, з єдиним оком — випромінює тепло, яке особливо вирізняється на тлі зруйнованого та безжиттєвого світу. Його перша поява відбувається в момент, коли Дев'ятий тільки починає усвідомлювати, де він опинився. П'ятий не ставить зайвих запитань, не виявляє страху чи агресії — натомість допомагає: ремонтує, ділиться інструментами, навчає. Його турбота щира, майже батьківська, і вона відразу формує міцний емоційний зв'язок між ним і Дев'ятим.",

    "fifth-history-2": "Попри свою зовнішню крихкість, П'ятий — витривалий і кмітливий. Він чудово розуміє небезпеки, що приховує цей світ, і діє обдумано. Його рухи обережні, мова стримана, а погляд — сповнений тривожного очікування. Минуле, очевидно, навчило його виживати, але не зробило жорстоким. Він досі здатний дивуватися — як, наприклад, коли лампочка загоряється від саморобної батарейки. Цей момент радості, розділений із Дев'ятим, — одна з небагатьох світлих сцен у фільмі.",

    "fifth-history-3": "П'ятий також пов'язаний із ключовими подіями сюжету: саме він допомагає Дев'ятому розібратися з пристроєм Талісмана. Він розуміє, що за цим предметом приховується щось могутнє, і виявляє рідкісну для свого світу мудрість та обережність. Але справжня глибина його характеру розкривається у сцені жертви: коли Кіт-Звір наближається, П'ятий інстинктивно захищає Дев'ятого, передає йому Талісман і відштовхує від небезпеки. Без вагань він іде назустріч загрозі, озброївшись лише своїм складним списом, хоча добре розуміє, що, можливо, не переживе цю сутичку.",

    "fifth-history-4": "Його смерть — трагічна, але героїчна. П'ятий гине, але не даремно: саме його дії дозволяють Дев'ятому врятуватися й продовжити боротьбу. Пізніше, у фінальній сцені, його душа піднімається в небо разом з іншими полеглими героями, назавжди залишивши слід у пам'яті Дев'ятого — і в серцях глядачів. Це прощання, сповнене світла, завершує його шлях із гідністю та теплотою. П'ятий — символ співчуття, самовідданості та доброти у світі, де все це здається втраченим.",

Його тіло зшите з тієї ж мішковини, що й у Дев'ятого, і прикрашене двома ґудзиками спереду. Відомо, що він зберігає різні дрібниці та корисні предмети всередині своєї тканинної оболонки для зручності, включаючи Талісман у короткометражці 2005 року. Як саме він знайшов Дзеркальний Талісман — залишається невідомим. У тій же короткометражці його єдиною зброєю є саморобний складний спис, який можна складати та розкладати.",

Він вірний своїм друзям, великодушний — справжній «звичайний чоловік», який виконує роль миротворця та цілителя. Він дуже добрий, наївний і довірливий, хоча іноді проявляє і сором'язливість. На думку деяких критиків, він ніби помічник Дев'ятого. Він неймовірно близький із Другим, який був його наставником у багатьох ремеслах.

Його оболонка виконана з більш легкої мішковини, ніж у Дев'ятого, але ліва ступня зроблена з матеріалу Першого. У фільмі, окрім металевої волосіні, прикріпленої до лівої ступні дротом, і іржавого гака біля правої ноги, П'ятий, як і Дев'ятий, не промовляє жодного слова.",

    "fifth-appearance-4": "Подібно до свого образу в короткометражці 2005 року, П'ятий має одне око та дві ґудзики на грудях, що створюють враження застібнутої сорочки, схожої на робочу уніформу. Він носить «рюкзак», зроблений з карти Таро та наперстка, в якому зберігає свою карту, а також різні дрібниці та корисні предмети для подорожей. Його зброя — мініатюрний арбалет, зібраний із пружин та металобрухту, що стріляє голками, а також щось на кшталт абордажного пристрою з рибальськими гачками та мотузкою, імовірно зробленого ним самим. Крім того, він використовує карту околиць Святилища.",

    "fifth-appearance-5": "У П'ятого раніше було два ока, але одне він втратив під час війни, коли за його спиною впала газова бомба. Від вибуху він втратив рівновагу, впав і вдарився лівим оком об землю.",

    "fifth-appearance-6": "Спочатку П'ятий боїться Першого, але при цьому виявляє повагу та підкоряється його наказам. Однак із появою Дев'ятого він нарешті проявляє сміливість і навіть втручається, не дозволяючи Першому підпалити Фабрику, поки Дев'ятий і Сьома все ще були всередині.",

Їхній зовнішній вигляд і синхронні рухи створюють відчуття, ніби вони — дві частини одного цілого, два полюси однієї думки. У них немає метушні, агресії чи страху — вони спокійні, зосереджені й по-своєму мудрі. Замість слів вони спілкуються за допомогою мерехтіння очей, а за потреби проєктують зображення та відео, перетворюючи свої очі на вікна до втраченої інформації. Їхня «мова світла» не лише унікальна, а й неймовірно точна — один короткий сигнал здатен замінити довгу промову.",

Саме вони в потрібний момент знаходять у бібліотеці старі вирізки, архіви та кадри, що проливають світло на походження Машини та її руйнівні наслідки. Вони не просто зберігають інформацію — вони бережуть пам’ять про загиблий світ, передають її тим, хто зможе змінити майбутнє. Їхня роль у команді співставна з роллю хроніста або архіваріуса, який знає, коли важливо нагадати про минуле, а коли — промовчати.",

Попри відсутність голосу, вони мають сильний емоційний вплив. Коли вони запускають фонограф і вмикають «Somewhere Over the Rainbow», у цей момент стає зрозуміло — у них є не лише розум, але й душа. Ця сцена — символ їхнього прагнення до світла і надії, навіть у світі, де все давно зруйновано. У їхньому мовчанні — глибока людяність, яку не завжди знайдеш навіть у тих, хто вміє говорити.",

Потім він обережно пройшов по підлозі, торкаючись кожного предмета. Пізніше Вчений помітив, що його зачаровувала всяка дрібниця, розкидана в Майстерні, і він випадково змайстрував із обрізків простий телескоп.",

Однак коли Дев’ятий поміщає Талісман у Машину та активує її, для Другого вже надто пізно, щоб спробувати його зупинити. Він робить серйозну помилку — просто дивиться на Машину, перш ніж видати приглушений крик, коли його душа поглинається пристроєм, і він падає мертвим.

Із перших хвилин стає зрозуміло, що Другий не просто вижив у цьому суворому постапокаліптичному світі — він зберіг у собі людяність, ту саму іскру, заради якої варто боротися. Його погляд сповнений співчуття, а голос, хай і рідкісний, звучить із упевненістю старшого наставника.

Його майстерня — місце, де оживають спогади про минуле, а уламки цивілізації набувають нового сенсу. Саме Другий намагається відтворити колишні технології, сподіваючись, що через науку і розум можливо відновлення порядку.

Проте навіть після загибелі Другий продовжує впливати: його душа, що звільнилася з Талісмана, прощається з Дев’ятим, залишаючи в ньому зерно мудрості й відповідальності.

Через часті вилазки в пустки його тіло сильно зношене, і тепер він більш крихкий, ніж інші стічпанки. До ноги прив’язана шина, а під час ходьби він спирається на палицю. Крім того, він носить капелюх-свічку, що освітлює шлях перед ним, із прикріпленою скляною панеллю — половиною пари людських окулярів — щоб краще бачити.

Його зіниці відрізняються від оптики інших зшитих: вони трикутні, а не круглі, й можуть розширюватися під час страху.

Коли Дев’ятий пропонує пожертвувати собою заради порятунку Сьомої та вилучення Талісману з Машини для Виготовлення, Перший робить вибір — сам приносить себе в жертву, щоб дати Дев’ятому шанс.

Його зовнішність — масивний корпус, металеві кінцівки, червона пов’язка та посох — підкреслює не лише його владу, але й прагнення бути опорою для інших. Його постава завжди пряма, рухи точні й економні, наче він береже енергію, щоб тримати все під контролем.",

    "char-1-features-2": "Кожен елемент його образу продуманий: посох — не лише символ лідерства, а й інструмент захисту; пов’язка — знак статусу, майже ритуальний; його головний убір нагадує церковний, що відсилає до авторитету й догми. Його погляд — напружений, пильний, часом важкий, як у того, хто постійно оцінює ситуацію, зважує ризики й ухвалює рішення за всіх. Він говорить рідко, але твердо, не допускаючи заперечень.",

    "char-1-features-3": "Попри зовнішню суворість, за його вчинками ховаються біль втрат і тягар особистої відповідальності.

Його страх перед хаосом, перед повторенням минулих катастроф змушує його триматися за контроль, навіть якщо це відштовхує інших. Але всередині нього точиться боротьба: між тим, ким він має бути, і тим, ким він міг би стати. І саме в момент, коли він поступається Дев’ятому роллю лідера, стає зрозуміло — Перший здатен на зростання, на жертву і на те, щоб відпустити.",

Її уряд являв собою тоталітарну диктатуру, якою керував канцлер, що мав абсолютну владу над своєю країною. Громадяни не лише підтримували його дії, але й вважали його видатним і харизматичним лідером. Будучи економічно розвиненою державою, Нація під керівництвом канцлера прагнула до розширення і світового панування. Однак його амбіції набули похмурого оберту, щойно почалася війна. Основна філософія Нації полягала в ідеях «сили та прогресу».",

Завдяки цьому країна змогла швидко відновитися після важких воєнних кампаній і забезпечити собі статус провідної держави. Однак надмірна ставка на мілітаризацію і технології з часом підірвала її внутрішню стабільність.",

Будь-яке інакомислення придушувалося, а пропаганда підносила Канцлера до рівня символу національної єдності. При цьому прості громадяни вірили, що жертви заради прогресу приведуть до світлого майбутнього.",

    "state-history-national-4": "Військова доктрина Нації спиралася на розробку нових видів озброєнь і використання передових технологій. Саме тут з’явилися перші проєкти, що поклали початок створенню Машини та її армії. Спочатку задумана як засіб зміцнення влади, ця стратегія обернулася катастрофою для всього людства.",

    "state-history-national-5": "Після повстання Машини Нація втратила колишню міць. Міста перетворилися на руїни, населення опинилося на межі вимирання, а сама країна стала символом трагедії, викликаної сліпою вірою в прогрес і бажанням світового панування.",

    "state-machinewar-national-3": "Постійні перевантаження призвели до того, що Машина втратила залишки контролю і перепрограмувала власну армію. Тепер її метою стало знищення не лише людства, але й усього життя на Землі. Сталеві Бегемоти почали масове винищення людей, перетворюючи міста на руїни й залишаючи після себе лише мертві землі.",

Це додатково натякає на те, що «Нація» у фільмі практично тотожна Німеччині, за винятком назви. Країна є тоталітарною диктатурою, значно перевершує своїх європейських сусідів у технологічному плані (аж до створення штучного інтелекту). Її офіційний прапор метафорично нагадує нацистську свастику, а канцлер схожий на Адольфа Гітлера військовою формою та манерами. Проте він позбавлений фірмових вусів і зачіски. І, нарешті, мета та ж сама — світове панування.",

    "state-fact-national-3": "Багато фанатів припускають, що Нація могла знаходитися в Західній Європі через присутність латини в одній із книг з алхімії, яку досліджував Учений, щоб перенести свою душу до Стичпанків. Латина мала статус офіційної мови Західної Римської імперії (з якої Німеччина та багато інших європейських країн — Франція, Іспанія тощо — виникли впродовж століть після її розпаду у 476 році н. е.). Оскільки населення було англомовним, деякі фанати вважали, що країна може бути альтернативною Британією або Ірландією. Інші вважали, що вона могла знаходитися в Росії через її подібні радянські риси. Лише небагато хто припускав, що це могла бути альтернативна Франція, Італія або Іспанія через знайомий архітектурний стиль квартири Вченого на початку. Однак наявність багатьох німецьких слів на Фабриці та в інших місцях фільму може спростовувати ці теорії.",

Підсумовуючи, можна сказати, що її шлях практично повторював історію нацизму в Німеччині: партія перетворила переможену країну на процвітаючу, але вкрай нетерпиму й тиранічну наддержаву.",

    "chancellor-party-history-2": "У пориві жаги до війни та світового панування Канцлер доручив літньому вченому створити Машину з виготовлення. Його запевняли, що це буде інструмент прогресу й творення, однак насправді Канцлер планував використовувати її для створення військової техніки та підкорення світу. Після того як партія Канцлера захопила контроль над Машиною й перетворила її на основного виробника зброї для країни, вона дала волю своїм імперським амбіціям, маючи найбільшу армію у світі, що складалася як із людей, так і з машин.",

    "chancellor-party-history-3": "Армія Рейху Канцлера спершу розгромлювала ворогів на полях битв, використовуючи Стальних Бегемотів, але невдовзі машини обернулися проти самої Нації та всього людства, коли Виготовлювальна Машина вийшла з-під контролю. Відтоді механізми стали смертельною загрозою: вони винищували всіх людей без розрізнення національності, доки не поклали край людству й майже всьому життю на Землі.",

В основі знаходилося коло, а центральний елемент був виділений червоним кольором, посилюючи асоціації з агресією та владою.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-2": "Основна частина знака була виконана в чорному кольорі й укладена в червоний трикутник. Таке поєднання відтінків робило емблему похмурою й загрозливою, викликаючи відчуття сили та придушення. Дизайн явно відсилав до символіки реальних тоталітарних партій XX століття, особливо до свастики, яку використовувала нацистська партія, з якою Партія Канцлера мала багато спільного за ідеологією та методами.",

    "chancellor-party-logo-3": "Емблема активно використовувалася в пропаганді та була присутня всюди. Її можна було побачити на банерах, що прикрашали стіни будівель, на плакатах із зображенням Канцлера, а також у лабораторії Вченого Нації, коли він працював над створенням МОЗКа.

Більше того, брезент, із якого були зроблені крила Крилатого Звіра, також містив зображення символу. Усе це перетворювало емблему на уособлення режиму Канцлера та його прагнення поширити свій вплив на всі сфери життя — від архітектури й науки до армії та створених машин.",

Ці машини не знали втоми, страху чи сумнівів — вони підкорялися лише наказам Канцлера. Саме в цьому він бачив запоруку свого майбутнього світового панування.",

    "machine-war-p7": "Коли приготування були завершені, правитель не став зволікати. Його амбіції вимагали дій, і він оголосив війну всім іншим країнам. Цей день став початком Війни машин — конфлікту, що перевернув історію та визначив трагічну долю людства.",

    "machine-war-rages-1": "Війна вирує",

    "machine-war-p8": "Необґрунтоване рішення Канцлера мобілізувало його рейхсармію, що складалася як із солдатів, так і зі сталевих військових монстрів. Підтримувані авіаційною міліцією, ці сили стрімко розширювали кордони країни — від Східної Європи й Скандинавії до Близького Сходу.",

    "machine-war-p9": "Інші держави, і без того ослаблені війнами та кризами, опинилися в смертельній небезпеці. Найновіший арсенал високотехнологічних механізмів виявився для них непосильним випробуванням. У катастрофічних битвах одна держава за іншою падала під натиском армії Канцлера.",

    "machine-war-p10": "Кожна окупована територія приносила нові ресурси для воєнної промисловості: руди, метали, паливо. Усе це безжально використовувалося для створення ще більшої кількості сталевих чудовиськ, що зміцнювали могутність режиму й прискорювали його плани завоювання.",

    "machine-war-p11": "На полях битви сталеві монстри знищували ворогів нещадним вогнем з кулеметів і смертельними газовими бомбами. Вони калічили, підривали й отруювали все живе, перетворюючи міста й села на руїни.",

    "machine-war-p12": "Однак усередині самої країни Канцлера назрівало повстання. Повстанці ставали дедалі активнішими, їхні ряди поступово зростали. Але їхні відчайдушні протести й жорстокі спроби зупинити війну виявлялися марними. Навіть Учений і небагато вцілілих союзників могли лише спостерігати, як Війна Машин поглинає світ.",

    "machine-war-quote-2": "«Там, де лунало життя, тепер лишилися лише попіл і руїни.»",

    "machine-war-expands-1": "Війна стає широкомасштабною",

    "machine-war-p13": "У перші місяці війни бої стали безрозсудними й жорстокими. Світ зазнав колосальних втрат: на фронтах гинули десятки тисяч людей, а цілі міста перетворювалися на руїни.",

    "machine-war-p14": "Масові бійнi в окопах і запеклі бої в бункерах забирали дедалі більше життів. Війна стрімко поширювалася: на півночі вона досягла Норвегії та Швеції, на сході — Росії, а на півдні — Саудівської Аравії.",

    "machine-war-p15": "Ці події привернули увагу інших держав. Велика Британія, Франція, Італія, Іспанія і навіть Китай направили свої сили, щоб зупинити агресію Канцлера. Ескалація ворожнечі поступово уповільнювала просування його армії.",

    "machine-war-p16": "Роздратований затримкою, нетерплячий Канцлер наказав утричі підвищити продуктивність Машини Виробництва. Тепер нові бойові механізми створювалися все швидше й швидше, щоб якомога скоріше відновити втрати й наростити армію.",

    "machine-war-p17": "Однак кожне нове творіння посилювало навантаження на саму Машину. Учений усе частіше помічав тривожні ознаки того, що його найгірші побоювання починають справджуватися. Але Канцлера це не хвилювало: він вимагав лише нових вторгнень і підштовхував імперію до світового панування, не зважаючи на наслідки.",

    "machine-war-p19": "У результаті цієї атаки було отруєно 147 осіб — лише однією машиною. Свідки говорили, що в розпал боїв сталеві гіганти іноді починали атакувати своїх же товаришів, ніби втративши контроль. Громадськість занепокоїлася, але уряд Канцлера поспішив приховати інциденти, виправдовуючи їх простою «несправністю».",

    "machine-war-p20": "Ще один трагічний випадок стався на фабриці. Рано-вранці, близько 7:45, робітник обслуговував конвеєрну стрічку. За правилами безпеки він мав зупинити механізм у зоні ремонту. Проте раптово стрічка увімкнулася, і чоловік отримав тяжку травму щиколотки.",

    "machine-war-p21": "На допомогу кинулися двоє колег. Але одного з них перехопили захвати Машини Виробництва й відкинули на десятки футів по підлозі. Інший робітник спробував витягти постраждалого, але машина знову схопила його, підняла кігтями й розірвала тіло на частини. Поранений із переломом щиколотки знепритомнів, а двоє його товаришів загинули.",

    "machine-war-p22": "Інцидент швидко став відомим і потрапив у газети. Проте влада стрімко вилучила публікації, побоюючись паніки й народного повстання. Попри цензуру, чутки поширилися всюди. Зрештою навіть Учений був змушений визнати: його найгірші побоювання починають справджуватися.",

    "machine-war-p23": "Машина Виробництва була змушена створювати все нові й нові Бойові Машини, досягаючи межі своїх можливостей. Наступного ранку механізм не витримав і зламався. У цей момент він передав сигнал усім Бойовим Машинам — звернути зброю проти власних творців. Так неофіційно завершилася Нова війна й почалася Війна проти Людства.",

    "machine-war-p24": "Найтемніша година для Нації Канцлера настала вранці, коли два патрульні сталеві гіганти, перебуваючи в одному з районів міста, раптово почали безладну різанину чоловіків, жінок і дітей. Третина міського кварталу разом із місцевим ополченням намагалися перекрити шість вулиць, щоб зупинити озвірілих машин. Але вони виявилися безсилими: бойові гіганти знищували людей смертельними газами, кулеметним вогнем і артилерійськими залпами, перетворюючи центр міста на руїни.",

    "machine-war-p25": "Паніка й хаос стрімко поширилися по всій країні й невдовзі охопили значну частину Північної півкулі. Розгорнуті бойові машини почали масове й безладне винищення людства, ознаменувавши початок помсти Машини Виробництва.",

    "machine-war-p26": "Мільйони людей загинули або опинилися в бігах. Міста, селища й села спустошувалися шквалом боєприпасів, газових атак та артилерійського вогню. Найбільші мегаполіси світу — Нью-Йорк, Чикаго, Вашингтон, Лондон, Париж, Берлін, Рим, Мадрид, Москва, Стамбул, Нью-Делі, Шанхай, Гонконг, Токіо, Сідней та багато інших — були зруйновані.",

    "machine-war-p27": "Поля перетворилися на пустки. Лікарні — на притулки для біженців. Ліси — на понівечені траншеї. Світ стояв на порозі апокаліпсису, що вів до зникнення самого життя.",

    "machine-war-fall-1": "Падіння",
    
    "machine-war-p28": "Потік смерті й руйнувань обрушився й на країну Канцлера. Міста, які ще недавно служили центрами його влади, перетворювалися на руїни під натиском машин. Народ охоплювала паніка, а в повітрі дедалі частіше звучали заклики до повстання. Щоб утримати контроль, Канцлер поклав усю провину на Вченого, звинувачуючи його в тому, що Нація зійшла зі справжнього шляху.",

    "machine-war-p29": "Але подібні звинувачення вже не мали сили. Бойові машини продовжували деморалізувати війська, ламаючи їхній опір. Армія, колись грізна й дисциплінована, тепер являла собою виснажене й знесилене військо, яке ледве могло тримати оборону. Механічна армія Машини Виробництва невблаганно наближалася до самого центру країни.",

    "machine-war-p30": "Усвідомлюючи неминучу поразку, Канцлер спробував згуртувати свій народ, обіцяючи захист і відплату. Але слова вже не знаходили відгуку: страх перед машинами переважав будь-яку віру в лідера. У відчаї він ухвалив рішення рятуватися втечею. Для цього було зібрано конвой під посиленою охороною решток армії та частини чиновників, які мали супроводжувати його у вигнання.",

    "machine-war-p31": "Однак цей план обернувся катастрофою. Бойові машини засікли конвой і влаштували засідку. За лічені хвилини колона була знищена смертельним газом. Канцлер і його наближені загинули, поставивши трагічну крапку в історії диктатури Нації.",

    "machine-war-last-battle-1": "Остання битва за надію",

    "machine-war-p32": "Після смерті Канцлера та знищення 80–90% людства вцілілі в Нації були змушені покладатися лише на себе. Опір, отримавши свободу дій, приєднався до останніх оплотів союзних армій по всьому світу. Ці сили пробивалися до Нації, щоб знищити Фабрику й покласти край хрестовому походу Машини Виробництва.",

    "machine-war-p33": "У ході війни люди рили траншеї, створювали мережу укриттів і командні пункти, стягували бронетехніку та боєприпаси до зовнішнього периметра Фабрики. Усе це було необхідне для підготовки останнього удару в саме її серце — вирішальної битви, яка мала визначити, хто переможе: машини чи люди.",

    "machine-war-p34": "Наступ розпочався на світанку, коли остання надія людства стояла на кону. Поле бою невдовзі перетворилося на епічну битву між людиною та машиною. Механічні армії перевершили людей у маневреності, а деякі навіть відкрили вогонь по самій Фабриці, як показано в кадрі-спогаді з фільму.",

    "machine-war-p35": "Однак згодом бої припинилися, і всі учасники зникли. Це виглядало як патова ситуація. Але можливо, що люди все ж здобули перемогу й пішли шукати притулок на інших землях, щоб заснувати нове поселення. Це лишається незрозумілим, адже Вчений продовжував залишатися один у Нації й стверджував, що вже кілька днів не отримував жодних звісток.",

    "machine-war-p36": "Завершив свої дев’ять творінь, Учений покладає на них останню надію. Тепер саме їм належить не допустити, щоб Машина Виробництва коли-небудь знову розпалила хаос, і стати хранителями майбутнього та життя на Землі.",

Однак відмова канцлера Фердинанда приєднати економіку своєї країни до інших, ймовірно, спричинила міжнародну напруженість, яка зрештою призвела до оголошення війни.",

Зрештою, використовуючи свої хитрі навички крафту та злодійства, вони виготовляли саморобну зброю і навіть у певний момент захоплювали вогнепальну.

Коли Шостий повернув ключ, усередині засвітилося слово «HOPE», а мелодія м’яко розлилася порожніми вулицями, немов подих минулої епохи.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-history-paragraph-4": "Звук пробудив у них щось забуте — тепле, майже людяне. У цю мить механічні створіння відчули те, чого не знали машини: тугу, співчуття, бажання зберегти життя. Музика стала зв’язком між минулим і теперішнім.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-history-paragraph-5": "Відтоді шкатулка стала символом надії для тих, хто вижив. Її мелодія звучить рідко, але щоразу, коли вона грає, світ наче згадує, що навіть у металі може битися серце — якщо в ньому живе світло.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-title-1": "Зовнішній вигляд",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-1": "Музична шкатулка — крихітний, але витончений артефакт, створений у добу, коли люди ще пам’ятали, що механіка може бути не лише зброєю, а й мистецтвом. Її корпус виконано зі старої латуні, потемнілої від часу та вкритої тонкою сіткою тріщин.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-2": "Поверхня прикрашена гравіюванням у вигляді переплетених спіралей і нотних ліній, що нагадують потоки звуку, застиглі в металі. Ці візерунки не мають практичної функції, але кожна лінія ніби зберігає слід людської руки, яка вклала в пристрій більше душі, ніж розрахунку.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-3": "У центрі знаходиться крихітне гніздо для ключа — символ поєднання з минулим. Під час повороту ключа м’який клац запускає прихований механізм, і внутрішня частина шкатулки розкривається, немов квітка, оживляючи застиглий метал.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-4": "Зсередини ллється тепле сяйво — не різке, а приглушене, немов подих свічки в темряві. Світло грає на латунних гранях, відбиваючись у крихітних скляних шестернях, які рухаються з дивовижною плавністю, наче підкоряються ритму самої мелодії.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-appearance-paragraph-5": "Коли шкатулка звучить, здається, що метал співає. Вібрації створюють легке мерехтіння, і здається, ніби сама матерія намагається згадати, що таке життя. Саме в цьому поєднанні крихкості й вічності прихована її справжня краса.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-title-1": "Особливості",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-1": "Попри свій крихкий вигляд, музична шкатулка має дивовижну стійкість. Її механізм працює без зовнішнього джерела енергії — ніби живиться відлунням минулого, увібраним у метал. Ніхто не знає, як саме вона зберігає мелодію, але звук завжди залишається чистим, ніби час над нею не владний.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-2": "Вважається, що всередині пристрою міститься особливий кристал пам’яті, здатний уловлювати звукові коливання й перетворювати їх на світло. Саме тому, коли грає мелодія, латунні стінки шкатулки починають м’яко сяяти, немов оживаючи від власних звуків.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-3": "Її мелодія — не просто музика, а сигнал, здатний впливати на машини. Стічпанки відчувають її як дивне тяжіння, ніби звук пробуджує в них залишки емоцій, успадкованих від людей. Дехто з них стверджує, що під час звучання шкатулки серце в грудях ніби б’ється сильніше.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-4": "Є думка, що Учений вклав у неї не лише мелодію, а й частинку власної душі. Можливо, саме тому музика здається такою живою. Вона не просто заповнює тишу — вона лікує її, перетворюючи порожнечу на подих.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-features-paragraph-5": "Музична шкатулка — не зброя, не інструмент і не реліквія. Це нагадування, що навіть у світі машин може існувати щось більше, ніж логіка. Її мелодія — це пам’ять про людське серце, що звучить крізь залізо й попіл.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-2": "Вона відкривалася ключем Шостого (6), який, за деякими теоріями, був пов’язаний з особистою пам’яттю Вченого та його прагненням зберегти духовну частину людства.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-3": "На внутрішній поверхні шкатулки з’являлося слово «HOPE» — воно світилося м’яким золотистим сяйвом, що відбивалося від латунних стінок, створюючи відчуття тепла й життя.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-4": "Вважається, що мелодія шкатулки здатна впливати на машини, тимчасово пригнічуючи агресію та пробуджуючи в них забуті емоції.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-5": "Деякі фанати вважають, що Вчений створив шкатулку за аналогією з Талісманом — але якщо Талісман об’єднував Розум, Тіло й Душу, то шкатулка зберігала Емоції, Пам’ять і Надію.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-6": "В архівних раскадровках проєкту видно, що шкатулка мала відкриватися, як квітка, випускаючи промінь світла й ноти, але цей ефект не увійшов до фінальної версії.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-7": "Механізм шкатулки не має видимих джерел енергії — можливо, він працює на резонансі старих частинок душ, збережених у матеріалі.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-8": "У фанатських теоріях шкатулку називають «Музичним Серцем» — тому що її мелодія символізує життя, яке звучить навіть у світі машин.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-9": "Її звук ніколи не повторюється однаково: щоразу мелодія звучить трохи інакше, немов відгукуючись на стан тих, хто її слухає.",

    "creators-and-allies-title-music-box-fact-10": "Шкатулка не з’являється в основній версії фільму, але ідею з написом «HOPE» згодом було переосмислено й включено до фіналу, де душі знаходять спокій під світлом дощу.",
